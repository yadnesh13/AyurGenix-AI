PREFACE 



« n the earliest philosophical works of the 

Hindus, namely the U pamshads, we meet 
with two schools of thought, the one 
taking its stand on Reason and universal Experi¬ 
ence, the other laying stress on certain 
practices that enable the seeker aftei Brahman 
to have an immediate foretaste of the bliss of 


Self Both believe m the oneness of existence, 
but the followers of the latter avoiding the 
laboui of reasoning, aim at controlling the activi¬ 
ties oE the mind, which after a long and steady 
course of piactice, they expect to lead to a direct 
leahsation of Brahman Pure reasoning, these 
hold, leads to nothing tangible, while meditation 
of the Adhyatmic kind opens the Path to 
Brahmic Bliss Thus while the rational school 


Acknowledges the absolute sovereignty of reason 
the othei unfurls the standard of Imagination 


In course of time these two elements noticed 
above have become hopelessly mixed up and 
most Udantie works contain a tincture oE 



11 


mysticism, side by side with abstruse leasonmg 

Doctrines of the most extravagant kind are 
authoritatively laid down and as unhesitatingly 
accepted Untenable dogmas are invested with 
a peculiar sanctity by unquestioned tradition 
and an atmosphere of mysticism is thereby 
created 

The fair name of Vedanta as a Science has 

consequently suffered and it is the duty, we 
conceive, of those who would stand up for its 
reputation to distinguish the rational fiom the 
so called practical side and point out the bed¬ 
rock of reason upon which the world renowned 
system is built 

The object we have had m view in bringing 
forward this translation is two fold First, to 
piesent the naturally unattractive subject of 
Vedantic philosophy in clearer and simpler 
language than is to be found m the translations 
already extant , and secondly, wherevei state¬ 
ments are made m the text in a crude, dogmatic 
or unconvincing form, to endeavour to provide 
explanatoiy notes appealing to minds trained in 
the modern methods of scientific reasoning and 



comparative cnticism The justification 
a procedure is left to the judgmen^o^ttfe- 
thoughtful 


Some scholais 


imagine 


that 


trusting to 


reason alone will lead but to diy abstract con¬ 
ceptions, while the occult practices will enable 
the devotee to 1 Vision' the '‘Substance ’ This is 
to condemn reason without fair trial Vedanta 
is no speculation Lt is the Science of the Sell 
which is no meie abstract idea or figment ol 
fancy , and leason fulfils hei function, onlj 
when she has landed the enquirer on the shore! 
of Tiuth, the realisation of the one only existence 


Sri Vidyaranya the greatest modern expo 
nent of Vedanta since Sn Sankara, is an undis 
puted authority accepted by all Indians His 
Panchadasi is an invaluable epitome of Vedanta, 
written in an easy intelligible style and calculated 

to readers desiring to 

on the intellectual side If this translation 
should help in any way to satisfy the cravings 
oE the anxious enquuer, our dearest wish will 
have been fulfilled and labouis rewarded 


study the subject 




is our pleasant duty to offei 


our grateful 



thanks to Mr B Somanathiah for having placed 
at our disposal all the documents he had collect¬ 
ed with infinite patience and true historic insight, 
bearing on the life of Sri Vidyaranya

will, when brought to our notice by kind 
critics, be thankfully acknowledged

INTRODUCTION 


Tee gist of the Vedanta is given in the 
oft quoted half of the verse which says 
“Brahman alone is real the world unreal and 
Jiva is identical with Brahman and no other” 
The innumerable sastras (scriptures) that have 
been written on Vedanta are intended to expound 
the nature of Brahman, of the world, of the Jiva, 

to show the unreality of the world and to lead 
one to a conviction of the oneness of Jiva with 
Brahman The Vedas, especially the Upamsha- 
dic portions and the Brahma Sutras ivith Sri 

Sankara’s commentaries are the fountain-heads 
of our knowledge on this subject of peiennial 
intei est to the human lace Any one wishing 
to obtain a perfect realisation of Vedantic truths 
must dive deep into the expositions of the Upa- 
nishads and Sutras Others who have neither 
the time nor the opportunity' to do so may get 
glimpses oE the lofty ideals of Advaitic thought 
from such works as Panchadasi which gives a 



A neglect of 


connected and reasoned account of the Vedanta, 

creating in the minds of the readers a desne to 
resort to the more authoritative and exhaustive 

scriptures 

In handling any metaphysical question, the 
point in dispute ought first to be established by 
xeference solely to human leason and expenence 
Quotations of authorities either personal 01 
scriptuial however great or lespectable would be 
appiopriate then and not before 
this elementary principle of procedure especially 
in religious or metaphysical controversies leads 
to endless confusion and fanaticism 
to the rule laid down heie uhichevei of the two 
disputants, fiist invokes the ud of God, Vedas, 
inscrutable mysteries of Providence, the written 
dicta of ancient preceptors 01 of their modern 
Aaatars will ha\e to confess himself discomfited 
An appeal to miracles io particularly out of place, 
for it is not the mention of names however 
formidable oi of incidents howevei extraoi dinary, 
that can serve to decide a point but only in 
immediate appeal to reason and experience 
Kea ertheless after a point has been satisfactoi ily 
established, quotations of* authonties though 


Accoidmg 



Til 


adding nothing to the weight of the argument 
will be sei viceable by way of removing the sting 
of pei sonal discomfittue, on the pait of the 
vanquished, the victoi appearing only to parti¬ 
cipate m the views of other great thinkers 

We should not have taken any pains at all 
to translate a Yedantic woik like Panchadasi 
if Vedanta could not have been established 
on the basis of puie leasonmg from experience 
In tact, the one excellent feature of Panchadasi 

is, that Vidyaranya, himself conscious of the 
proper canon of discussion ha* begun his 

treatise with no dogmatic assertion 01 assump¬ 
tion , neithei with a cool quotation from scnp- 
tures We only wish that other waters on 
Vedanta had followed the same sti ictly rational¬ 
istic method of Vidyaianya Hence the claim 
of Vedanta to the unquestioned lank of a 
science 

Vidyaianya, the learned aufchoi of Pancha¬ 
dasi divides his work into thiee sections, each 
section containing five chapteis The fust 
bection deals with the investigation into the 
nature of Biahman, of diva, and of the world, 



the unreality of the world md the onene- of 
li\*i with Bnhman The^rond section treat- 
of the enlightenment derived from t cour-e of 
enquiry and die third of tin bli*>- obtlined from 
enliglitenment 



Some Account of the Life of 

Vidyaranya. 


Vidyaranya is the reputed author oE 
‘Panchadasi’ The word “reputed” is used 
advisedlj, for there are some who believe that 
Vldyaranya could not have written a work of 
this kind Others however, while accepting the 
first five chapters as having been written by him 
proEess to think that some pandits of the court 
of Vizianagar completed the work and gave the 
credit of it to Vidyaranya It is no part of our 
business to engage in a contioversy of this 
character, for we think that the work is more 
important than the authoi and are content to let 
things stand as they are The works attributed 
to Shakespeare lose none oE their worth, even 
though some arc anxious to make out Bacon to 
be the real author Such controversial points 
have a peculiar charm of their own, but our 
appreciation of Hamlet, Lear, and Othello is none 
the less, for want of a final pronouncement on

are repiesented to be according to tradition 
Madhava himself could not have passed his 
youth m poveity European scholars have

bhatta and his mother’s name as M&chambika 

The Shikarpur inscription is very lehable as it 
was inscribed on a rock at the tune of and under 
the orders of Madhava himself. From this we 
also learn that his gotra was “ Angnasa ” His 
ancestors were the family gurus of Sangama 
the father of Bukka and Harihara under whom 
Madhava served as minister, general and Viceroy 
As Sangama was a Raja of Anegondi of some

“ Soota Samhita Yyakhya ” appears to be one of

very learned scholars, having received the same 
educational advantages as Madhava 

From a study of a number of mscuptions 
it may be concluded that Madhava helped Bukka 
and Hanhara to found the empire of Yizianagar, 
acting as the commander m-Chief of the army 
sent to relieve Goa He also acted as their 
minister and subsequently as the Viceroy of the 
"Western Districts of the newly-founded empire,

a Sanyasm in his extreme old age as he wrote 

many excellent works after he entered into

beginning of “Sankara Vijaya” show that 

Madhava must have spent a large part of his 
life m Royal Courts either flattering others or 
being flattered by them and that feeling sorry 
for such a misuse of life, he retired from court 
and turned his attention to a study of Vedanta. 
His salutation addiessed to Sri Sankarananda at

but we can safely assume that the death of 
Vidyaranya took place long after 1381 It is 

not know n whether his body was buried at

The object of the author is to show that what

clearly establish the authontatneness of the Vedas, as 
their teachings are simply an expiession of the facts of

6 This consciousness is distinct from its 
peicept (ignorance) and does not, as conscious¬ 
ness, diffei from itself but is identical with cons¬

It will be generally admitted that this 

objectless consciousness persists only during the life time 
of a man but it ma> not be conceded that it persists for 
e\er But all destruction can refer only to objects of 
perception while that which always exists as the basis

continuous exertion of will power to keep the 

mind fixed on Atma, still as a result of repeated

such efforts m previous births, one effort of will 
prior to entering Samadhi is enough to keep the

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER I 


After offering profound salutations to hie spiritual 
teacher, Vidyaranya at onoe proceeds to establish the 
subject of his discourse, Brahman, by appealing to 
human reason and experience In the Wakeful state, 
objects having varying properties are perceived 
They are known as percepts When the percepts 
are considered apart from the consciousness which 
perceives them, the latter is seen to be one 
and the same always In the dreaming state, there 
are also percepts perceived by a consciousness which 
undergoes no change The percepts of the dreaming 
state differ from the percepts of the wakeful state in 
being associated with a notion of transcienoy—whereas 
the latter are associated with a notion of relative perma 
nency The same consciousness also persists m dream 
less sleep as is seen from the assertion of one who wakes 
from sleep and says “I knew nothing in my sleep 
That is to say consciousness perceives nescience which 
becomes the percept This consciousness m no way 
differs in identity from the consciousness of wakeful and 
dreaming states, because one and the same individual 
refers the experiences of all the three states to himself 
The consciousness of one day is the same as that of 
another day It likewise continues unbroken through 



29 


iges So it is without origin and without end (1 e ) 
iternal and ever existing, for death cannot be predicated 
>f it Percepts only arise and are destroyed and the 
consciousness that witnesses the origin and destruction 
af percepts can never be said to die. for to do so, it must 
become a percept which is unthinkable The onl} thing 
therefore that is immortal is consciousness This evei 
existing consciousness is the Atma ^.11 objects oi 
percepts are loved not for then sakes but for the sake of 
one s own Self The Self is loved not for the sake of 
anything or any body else but for its own sake Being 
beloved for its own sake, it is necessarily of the nature 
of bliss Seasoning thus from facts of unneisal 
experience, we establish the Self to be of the nature of 
existence, consciousness and bliss This Self is 
identical with Brahman or Paramatma as taught in the 
XJpamshads We may observe, in passing, that this is 
the one and the only one method by which Brahman 
can be established We would request our readers to 
become throughly familiar with this method as we have 
to refer to it over and over again in the subsequent 
pages This is the key which unlocks all the doois m 
the citadel of Vedanta With the help of the 
Avasthatraya method one can comprehend numerous 
points which would otherwise lemain inexplicable The 
I Self which as proved above is one with Brahman, does 
not recognise itself to be Brahman, simply through 
ignorance of its own leal nature The conscious Self runs 
as a continuous thread through the three states of 



30 


waking, dream and dreamless sleep In sleep as we 
showed before, there is Self plus the percept nescience, 
in dream, Self plus the dreaming world, and in the wak 
ing state, the Self plus the world as commonly under 
stood The Self is common to all the three states, the 
percepts only varying When a person passes from 
sleep into the dreaming condition, where does the 
dieamy world he is conscious of, come from? Its 
origin could be only from nescience the percept in the 
dreamless sleep, or when a man passes from deep sleep 
into the waking condition where does the waking world 
come from? The only source of it would be nescience 
Theiefore it is plain that the nescience alone is the 
cause of both dreamy and wakeful worlds It is possible 
to construct any numer of theories to account for the 
origin of the world but all conceivable theories must end 
in positing nescience to begin with Experience does 
aot contradict reasoning We are conscious of our 
lescience and consciousness in no waj contradicts the 
jxperience of nescience Indian Philosophers coll this 
lescience 1 Praknti and construct an elaborate expla 
lation of how this world came to be what it is The 
fedic exposition of the process of creation is given by 
hdyaranya in stanzas 15 36 of the 1st Chapter To 
he Indian mind this appears to be the least objection 
bie 0 f all possible theories But after all is said and 
one to the real Vedautin this is as unreal as the Vedas 
jemselves Lord Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that the 
'edas treat of the three gunas The three Gunns 



31 


referred to here are the Si tva, Rajas and Tamas which 
are the constituents of primordial matter or Praknti 
The Gunas by themselves cannot be properly understood 
but it is possible to have some idea of what they are by 
the effects they produce Sat tva leads to calmness, 
renunciation generoritv uprightness etc v Rajas to 

activity, desire, passion attachment to objects, greedi¬ 
ness ere and Tamas to folh, fear ignorance etc 
Where there is a preponderance of Sattva Guna, pra 
kriti is called Mai a and when the other two Gunas 
predominate it is known is Avidya This is the proper 
significance attached to each of these three words, but 

this is often lost sight of and the words Prakriti Ma\ a 
and Avidia are used indiscriminately to mean the same 

thing The reflection of Brahman in Maya becomes 
Iswara and in Avidya Ji\a The Jn a is credited with 

three bodies, the Karana (causal), the Sookshma (subtle) 
and the Stboola (gross), or with five sheaths viz , 
Ananda (Bliss) Buddhi (Intellect), Manas (mind), 
Prana (Yital airs) and Anna (food) The causal body 
also known as the sheath of bliss is nothing more than 
Avidy a The term causal is appropriate because of its 
being Prakriti in the undifferentiated state , so also the 
term body (deha) on account of its liability to destruc 

tion when Brahman is realised The subtle body is 
made up of the three sheaths of Prana (vital airs) 
Manas (mind) and Buddhi (intellect) The sheath of 
Prana is composed of the five Pranas or vital airs and 
the five organs of action e g , organ of speech, hands, 



3 2 


feet, anus, and the genital organ The sheath of mmd 
is made up of mmd, the faculty of doubt, combined with 
the five sensory organs The sheath of intellect is 
formed of intellect the faculty of certitude, combined 
with the five sensory oigans The gross body is the 
sheath of food All embodied beings have their senses 
naturally directed outwaids and are devoid of the true 
knowledge of their inner self They act that they may 
enjov and m enjoying become attached to the objects of 
enjoyment, which incites them to action again, 
Thus without ever enjoying supreme bliss they 
pass from one birth to another till they receive 
initiation at the hands of a true teacher who 
has himself realised Brahman Then differentiating 
A.tma from the five sheaths they attain supreme 
bliss By making use of the principle of the 

determination of the invariable and the variable, we 

can see that the Atma ol the Self is the only invariable 
element m all conditions or states of sleep dream, 
waking and enlightened reflection (samadhi), while all 
\ the sheaths are variable, being present only under 
\ p ar fc ic ular conditions Therefore 4tma is one with 

! Brahman as taught m the holy text “ that thou art 
(Tat tvamsi) Brahman who when associated with 
Maya, is the material and the instrumental cause of 

this world is denoted by “ that and the same Brahman 
Tchen associated with Avidya, which incites one to desires 
and activities is denoted by " thou By setting aside 

the conflicting varieties of Maya and Avidya, there 



34 


remains the one indivisible Biahman of the nature of 
existence, consciousness and bliss E nquiry, reflectio n 
and unbroken contemplation are fcbe means hy whiclj 


one can attain to s amadbi or_enhghtened reflection, 
when the supieme bliss of Biahman is iealised 
Samadbi destroy s the effects of action m present and 
past births and enables one to have direct cognition 
of Brahman

well differentiated (To perceue these qualities) 
there are the five sensor) oigans of hearing, 
touch, sight, taste and smell 

This classification of matter into the five 
elementals is founded on a Psychological basis and does 
not m any way conflict with the teachings of etnperical 
sciences The elementals are postulated meiely accord 
mg to the senses they affect Hence no discoveries of 
science can in any way clash with this classification 
By ether is meant that portion of matter which can be 
perceived by the sense of hearing, air b 3 hearing and 
touch, fire by bearing, touch aud sight, water by 
hearing, touch, sight and taste and the earth by all the 
five senses This classification steers clear of both 
realism and Idealism

are being taken into the stomach Absence of

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER II 


-o- 

Knowledge of Biabman described as secondless 
Existence, can be got by differentiating it from the fi\e 
elementals* Akasa, Air, Fne, Water and Earth This 
classification of matter into the five elementals is found 
ed on a psychological basis and does not in any wa> 
conflict with the teachings or discoveries of einperical 
sciences They are postulated mereK according to the 
senses thev affect Akasa or ether is that poition of 
matter, the effects of which appeal to the sense of 
hearing, air to hearing and touch, fare to hearing, touch 
and sight, Watei to hearing, touch, sight and taste and 
earth to all the five senses The five elementals aie the 
primal constituents of the phenomenal universe and as 
such they can never be peiceived, though they contain 
in them the possibilities of becoming manifested Each 
of the perceived elementals contains one half of its own 
proper principle and one eighth of each of the ocher four 

The five organs of sense and the five organs of 
action are controlled b> the internal organ or Antah 
karana which is divisible into two portions, mind 
f man as) the faoulty of doubt and intellect fbuddhi) the 
faculty of certitude The Antahkarana is made up of 
the three gun as satva, rajas and tarn as, the effects of

which are given in the summary of the first chapter 
The Anfcabkarana will consequently be undergoing modi 
fications Satvic acts give rise to merit, Rajasic to 
dement and Tamasic to neither Tamasic acts cause 
wastage of life time Idea of egoity begets the idea of 
agency When egoity or personality becomes attached 
to buddhi (intellect) it is the usage of the world to con

exists means that the existence of Brahman accompanies 
4kasa as its basis But Maya which evolved Akasa 
from Brahman, made Akasa and Brahman look non 
different from each other as when we say 4 Akasa 
exists and then caused the real existence of Brahman to 
appear as a mere attribute having Akasa as its basis, 
as when we say ‘ Akasa has existence Before enquiry, 
Brahman appears as the phenomenal universe but 
whea after enquiry, the lllusoiy nature of the universe 
comes to be known, Brahman is recognised as the real 
basis Existence ot Brahman is the inseparable accom¬ 
paniment of all things and Akasa is not If existence 
is separated in thought from Akasa, nothing of Akasa is 
left The appearance of an object which does not 

really exist is simply illusion like an elephant 
seen in a dream A conviction of the truth of the 
difference between Brahman and Akasa will come about

elementals In a portion of the elemental earth is 
manifested the universe known as ^rabmanda* 
(Brahma s egg) containing ail possible kinds of worlds 
suited to be the abodes of all conceivable varieties of 
living beings By separating the real entity underlying 
the Brabmanda as a whole and the various bodies 
individually they aie all reduced to unreality But 
their continuing to appear real, even after one is 
convinced of their unreality is no guarantee of their 
reality and the appeaiance of an unreal thing (as for 
instance in a dream) cannot constitute a claim for the 
existence of a second thing b> the side of the secondless 
Brahman When the elemental*, the results of their 
combination and Maya aie realised to be on an equal

affect the comprehensionof the secondless one Therefore 
whatever be the changes that might occur in our con

for they lie altogethei outside his sphere Discoveries 
of science can still be described in fceims of perception

The notion of force implies some resistance to

to the muscular system of man As such, force, energy,

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER III 


Taittireya Upamshad describes Brahman as being 
hidden id a cavern of five sheaths of food, prana, mind 
intellect and bliss Atma is not to be identified "with 
any of the five sheaths It is the witness, and the 
experiences of all the five sheaths are to be referred to 
the principle of egoity superimposed on the witness 
As Atma is of the nature of consciousness, it cannot 
become an object of experience If Atma did not exist 
at all, no one can possibly experience (1 e ,) be conscious 
of the five sheaths as such Brahman may be deter 
minded by giving up the idea of object in all the 
percepts and taking the objectless consciousness 
which remains Ii in the knowledge of five sheaths, 
you give up the objective element (i e,) the sheaths, 
what remains is the witness, the Belf of the nature of 
pure consciousness Non existence cannot be predicated 
of it as it is not open to anybody to doubt one’s bwn 
existence If one denies the existence of Brahman, he 
denies his own existence, for Brahman is no other than 
the Self Existence, consciousness and infinity are 
given in tbeoVedas as indications of Brahman which is 
beyond the reach of words or intellect Existence is 
that which is nob liable to destruction If names and 



100 


forms are got rid of from the objective world, existence 
alone remains The objection that “ nothing * remains 
when names and forms aie destroyed, is overcome by 
saying that the very consciousness which enables one 
to say that nothing exists, is Brabman besides even 
that 11 nothing ’ cannot be predicated unless as " known ’ 
which implies again consciousness As Brahman is 
beyond speech and can never be handled as the object 
of knowledge, Vedas describe it as “ neti “ neti (1 e,) 

“ not this * not this Every percept can be given 
up but it is impossible to exclude the witness who can 
never become the percept Therefore that which is 
indestructible is Brahman An exoteric waj of proving 
Brahman to be infinite is to say, that he is not limited 
by space, as he is all pervasive that he is not limited 
by time as he is eternal that he is not limited by 

objects as he is of the nature of everything in the 
universe The esoteric way of doing the same, is to 
say that as time, space and objects aie figments of 
illusion (maya), Brahman is infinite The idea of Jit a 
and Iswara are superimposed on Brahman by the 


associates Avidtaand Maya respectrvely That is to 
gay, the same Brahman becomes Ji\a when associated 


with the five sheaths caused by Avidta and Iswara when 
associated with Maya When Brahman is considered 
apart from Maya and the five sheaths, there is neither 
Iswara nor Jrva Brahman is thus to be realised

word must not be ignored lb means 11 he saw ” and 
refers to the first stage of creation which was made 

possible only through the pure consciousness objectify 
mg itself This objectifying is spoken of as 1 Maya ’ 

The question of when and why this objeotification 
arose is inadmissible for we are here explaining the 
origin of the world which includes time, space and 
causality Hence there cannot be a point of time 
when the objectification came about as time itself owes 
its birth to the objectification in question Neither can 

there have been a cause of the origin of the world, m

much from the figure Though the sparks are partB of

Individuation always presupposes differentia

individual soul can have originated after individuation, 
the effects due to primal differentiation must be attn

cannot apply in the case oE objects perceptible 
to the senses in the wakeful state

29 Or just as sunlight assumes the shapes

external objects are perceived, assumes the forins

30 The Vartikakara also saj s that cogni¬ 
tion proceeds only from the cogniser Cogni 
tion becomes associated with the cognised 
object Such cognition when perceiving objects 
is united with them and assumes their shapes 

The Indian Psychology of perception is eS 
plained here The senses which alone come into 

contact with objects e g Rays of light &c carry fcb© 
impulses to the mind which then assumes the form (?f 
the object and in conjunction with the perceiver, is 
said to perceive it

31 Such being the case, in the percep 



iu 


eg, a pot, theie aie two 
factors one earthy and the other mental The 
earthy portion of it is cognised by the mind 
and the mental poition of it by the witnessing 
consciousness 

This is not to ba too literally understood In 
modern language, the internal organ is made up of two 
departments, the faculty of perception and the faculty of 
understanding The foimer deals with the perception 
of objects as such and the latter imposes on them 
notions due to its own egoistio predilections, while 
what is kno*n as the witness is absolutely unaffected 
by them Of " Sakshi, cheta kevalo nirgunasoha 1 

32 By making use of the principle of 
presence and absence, we see that it is the 
operations of understanding that lead to the 
bondage of Jiva When they are present, 
pleasure and pam their effects are present 
In their absence neither exist 


tion of an object

33 In dreams, though external objects 
are not present, mental operations bind one to 
pleasure and pain But in the state of enligh¬ 
tened reflection (Samadhi), of dreamless sleep 
and of fainting, though external objects may 
be near, one is not bound b\ pain or pleasure 
(as mental operations are absent) 

A better case in point is that of one emaocipa 
pated in life (Jivanmukta) His perceiving faculty 
continues to operate but owing to cessation of 
the operation of the egoistic portion of the 
faculty of understanding, the percepts do not affect 
him by way of causing pleasure or pain 

34 Though the son may be alive m a

SUMMABY OF CHAPTEB IV 



Duality is of two kinds, one, created bj Iswara and 
the other created by Jiva One may remark 11 where is 
the necessity for predicating Iswara at all ? This may 
be answered as follows Individuation always piesup 
poses differentiation Since all that comes withm the 
sway of the individual soul can have originated after 
individuation the effects due to primal differentiation 
must be attributed to a cause different from the mdivi 
dual soul This cause is denoted by the conventional term 
Iswara who is nothing more than Brahman associated 
with Maya The origin of Jiva is explained on the 


analogy of reflection The causal body is Avidya but it 
has to develop into the subtle body before the Jiva 
could act Therefore the reflection of pure conscious 
ness m the subtle body gives rise to Jiva in the active 
state, as otherwise the sense of individuality would not 
have 'arisen , for in the state of sound sleep when Jiva 


is shrouded in Avidya, the principle of individuation is 
not seen to operate The Mayic force associated with 
Iswara creates the universe and gives rise to illusion by 

Jiva forget himself Jiva coming under the 


making J J Va iorgeo uxujbou -- —■ 

we r of illusion believes himself powerless and 

identifying himself with the body becomes immersed in 
sorrow Objects created by Iswara preserve the same 



129 


nature but according to the vaned mental state* of the 

enjo>er, one and the same object may give rise to 

pleasure or pam or indifference The Antabkarana or 

the internal organ is made up of two departments, the 

faculty of perception and the faculty of understanding 

The former deals with the objects of perception as such 

and the lattei imposes on them notions due to its own 

egoistic predilicbions In the case of Jivanmukta, the 

perceiving faculty continues to operate but owing to the 

absence of the egoistic portion of the faculty of undei- 

standing, the percepts do nob affect him by way of 

causing pleasure or pain To all living creatures the 

mental world in whioh each lives is the cause of 

bondage To break the bonds of Samsara, it is not 

necessary that the duality of Iswara’s creation should 

be destroyed, but one should be convinced of the falsity 

of this duality by knowing the nature of the second less 

Atma When all duality disappears as m the case of 

dreamless sleep it is not possible bo know the second 

less Atma That is to say, an unenlightened man going 

into dreamless sleep cannot hope to come back from it 

enlightened as no means of instruction should have 

been left, when the teacher and the scriptures have all 

been bundled away with duality as they are in dream 

less sleep Therefore the duality of Iswara s creation 

is not only no obstacle to obtaining true knowledge but 

it is a direct help to it The duality of mental creation 

of Jiva is of two kinds, that which is in conformity 

with scriptures and that which is prohibited in them 

P 9 



130 


The first should be accepted till knowledge of Brahman 
arises and then thrown away It consists m enquiry 
into the nature of Brahman The second is of two 
kinds, sharp and dull The former is that in which 

desire, anger etc, become manifest and the latter is 
that conjured up by mind m day dreams Both kinds 
of duality prohibited m the sasfcras (scriptures) should be 
overcome before enquiry into Brahman is begun, as there 
by, mental calmness and power of fixing attention are 
obtained Enquiry into the fettering nature of all 
objects of desire, is one of the means of giving them 
up Indulgence in day-dreams should likewise be 
given up as attachment to objects is caused thereby 
(Vide Gita II 62) Mental creation should be overcome 

by meditation on the attributeless Brahman, by practis 
mg the pronunciation of Pranava (Om) realised as the 
symbol of the Self persisting through the states of 
waking, dream and dreamless sleep When the world 
as a percept has been wiped out by the knowledge of 
unreality of all phenomena, bliss of emancipation 
arises When the mind of a man is never attracted by 
objects, he is not to be called a knower of Brahman 
but becomes Brabman himself

1 The Aitereva Upamsbad says that that 
which is the basis of the operation of the organs 
of sight, heaimg, smell, speech and taste—the 
last of which perceives sweets and bitters, is 
consciousness 

In common parlance man is said to be cons¬ 
cious when his intellect is operating In Vedanta, this 
has to be taken as intellectual consciousness only, while 
pure consciousness is to he identified as existence 
running like a thiead fclnough all the three states of 
wakefulness, dream and dreamless sleep This is Atma 
and it never is absent even when a man is commonly 
said to be unconscious and asleep

bodies of the four-faced Brahma, Indra, men,

3 The infinite Brahman becomes known

changed witness of intellect in the human body

the knowledge of Self 


Here Brahman investing himself (even 
illusorily) with the human body was necessary as the 
highest step in evolution, since it is only when united 
with human intellect, that it can acquire a knowledge 
of its own nature The reason whj evolution evei 


began is explained by the hypothesis of the causeless 
Avidya Avidya embraces the whole of the phenomenal 
world which is characterised by time, space and causa 
hty Cause as known to us is only the antecedence of 
one event to another Hence causality is restricted 


purely to the sphere of time and space To speak of 
the cause of Avidya is to abuse oui causal facult>

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER V 


Four holy texts are chosen, one from each of the 
four Vedas The Aitereya Upanishad of the Rig Veda 
says “Pragnanam Brahman’ (oogB iousness is Bra h¬ 
man) This consciousness considered apart from all 
percepts, is common to all embodied beings and hence 
one and the same The Bnbadaranyaka Upanishad of 
Yajur Veda says H Aham Brabmasm i ” (I am Br ahman ) 
The infinite Brahman becomes known as I ” when 
manifesting himself as the unchanged witness of 
intellect in human body, this embo diment being 
necessary to overcome illusion auditor acquiring the^ 
knowIedgeoTSefi Brahman is that which is naturally 
unlimited an definite The identity of “ I M and Brah 
man is taught in the text u I am Brahman *’ The 
Ghandogya Upanishad of Sama Veda says “jFat 
Tw apoasi” (That thou art) ^ “That denotes the entilv 
which before creation was nameless, formless 
secondless, and which remains the same to the enquire 
" Thou " denotes the entity which transcends thf* //, 
and senses of the enquirer The identity of 41 % ^ 

and u thou ” is taught m the Upamebad Tot /

9 As the hills &c,m a pictuie aie not 
represented as wearing clothes, so the inanimate 
objects m creation, e g, eaith &c, are not 
endowed with a reflection of consciousness 

Here an attempt is made to account for the 
creation of animate and inanimate nature To the 
Vedantin everything other than self h e ,) all percepts 
including human bodies is other than consciousness and 
hence unreal The real element in every individual 
can never be seen and is one secondless consciousness 
admitting of neither division noi distinction

10 To considei that the pleasures and 
pains of this world are real and that they 
actually affect Paramatma is an illusion due to 



141 


ignorance which can only be removed by a tiue 
knowledge 


11 Pleasures and pains of this worldly 
life can aftect onJ) the Jiva a reflection of Atma 
and never the Atma itself This is true know 
ledge and can be acquired by enquiry

12 Therefore we must always be engaged 
in an enquiry into the nature ot this universe,, 
the Jiva and Atma When the notions of 
reality of the world and Jiva are destroyed, 
what remains is pure Atma 

5R i i \\ 11 

13 The destruction of the world and 
J lva does not mean that they should become 
imperceptible to the senses, but there should 
wise a determination of their unreal nature for 



142 

if that were not the case people may find 
emancipation without any efforts on their part 
a^ during dreamless sleep and fainting (when 
precepts altogether disappear ) 

* *pristgfcrf IM# n 

14 That Atma remains as the sole real 
factor, means that theie should be a lealisation 
of Brahman as the sole entitj and not a mere 
absence of the cognition of the woild otherwise 
there would be no ^uch thing as emancipation 
in tins life 

No other system of religion or philosopbv 
bolds out the possibility of transcending evil in this 
life The existence of evil is piously believed b> all 

others to be more than counterbalanced bv a reward in 
the Hereafter To the rationalist, this sort of conso 
lation is both dubious and childish The uniqueness of 
Vedanta consists in offering by rigid reasoning, a 
positive solution of the problem of evil and appealing to 
experience restricted to this life alone for its 

correctness

(intellect) (‘ Intellect 9 is here to be taken to 
mean the Primal Avidya or Mula Avidya) 
The reflection of Kootastha m intellect beais 
“vital airs” (Pianas) and comes to be known as 
Jiva who is subject to transmigrations 

The doctrine of Transmigration is based on the 
eternity of consciousness As consciousness cannot 
originate or end, its existence through all past time 
must be conceived as repeated acts of embodiment 
Similarly also in the future, until the realisation of 
Brahman takes place It is therefore to be conceded to 
be as real as the rest of our worldly experience This 
compares favourably with the illogical conception of the 
unaccountable birth of souls, believed m by the 
followers of other religions

24 Just as the 4 Ether m a pot ’ is hidden 
by Jalakasa when the pot is filled with water, 
so Kootastha is masked by Jiva This masking 

is known as mutual superimposition

“Yikshepa” (poner of manifestation) and 
‘ Avarana ” (power of concealment) The 
latter is the cause of one’s saj mg that Kootastha 
does not exist and is not manifested 

This twofold nature of Avidja is comparable 
to the centripetal and centrifugal forces which arc fin an

27 Being asked by a wise man about 
Kootastha, an ignorant man will reply that 
there is no Kootastha and that he does not

itself, suppose the Jiva to be essentially unconscious 
To escape from this position, they, in defining Iswara, 
invest him with the attribute of permanent conscious*

ness, bufc this device does not help them, for at best, 
it can only be a dogmatic asseifcion, since reasoning from 
the known nature of Jiva in whom consciousness is 
supposed to be present only during wakeful and 
dreaming conditions and absent in that of dreamless 

sleep, the conclusion is inevitable that consciousness 
wherever it is an attribute can come into play only 
occasionally This would make Iswara as much subject 
to ignorance as Jiva himself

127 The nature of pots and other in¬ 
animate objects is Jada (le) absence o£ 
intelligence Worldy wise men say that where 



182 


the power of intellect becomes futile, that is the 
sphere of Maya 

The sphere of intellect is with regard to all 
emperical sciences, circumscribed by Maya Everj fact 
of phenomenal experience can be connected with its 
cause only up to a certain point beyond which the 
greatest scientist or the wisest philosopher must confess 
his ignorance Maya thus sets a limit to the enquiry 
into the causes of things and seems to lay down the rule 
“ thus far and no further For instance in Chemistrj, 
we know that Hydrogen and Oxygen combine to form 
water but why they should do so and in certain propor 
tions only and why the result could not be otherwise, 
are beyond the ken of human intellect Any and every 
topic of discussion will be found to be enshrouded in 
this ultimate mystery which the human wit can never 
pierce This occasion mav incidentally be taken to 
prove the absurdity of the enquiry into the cause of 
Avidya (ignorance) For the sphere of intellect being 
limited in all directions by Avidya the notion of a cause 
which is derived from intellectual experience and is 
therefore legitimately lostncted to it cannot overstep 
the bounds of the intellect itself The expression, 'tbo 
cause of Avidya* is therefore as meaningless as the 
expression “ I died yesterday Although the Sorm of 
such an expression is possible by usage, the relation 
between cause and Audya is unthinkable Thcreforo 
the expression has no content and 4wd>a is causeles*

128 Thus the primal ignorance is 
admittedly experienced by all people From a 
logical point of view Maya becomes indefinable 
as described m Vedas that it is neither existence 
(like Brahman) nor non-existence (like a barren 
woman’s son)

129 As the effects of Maya’s operations 
are manifest it cannot be said not to exist As 
it is destroyed by knowledge, its real existence 
cannot be predicated As it constantly suffers 
destruction whenever viewed with the eye of 
knowledge, it must be mere illusory appearance

(lestricted to emperical sphere) it must be said

to be indefinable from that of the unenlighten

Homogeneous unity must mean a conglomerate of 

numberless things all of the same kind This knocks 

the doctrine of scientific monism on the head The aim 

of philosophy is to reduce a number of phenomena to 
one principle, hence any theory that does not tend

The system ol Vedanta is often stigmatised as 
pessimistic Even Schopenhauer is held up to contempt 
because his views are Vedantio That Vedanta is not 
pessimistic will follow from a consideration of the 

following Firstly, A person waking from dreamless 
sleep does not point back to a painless nothing but to 
positive bliss that he experienced Secondly, The 
kind of pleasures and pain6 that are condemned by 
Vedanta as leading to bondage are only such as spring 
from egoism Besides positive pain in this life which 
©very one would like to avoid, the pleasures which 
appear as such only when restricted to individual ex 
penence are themselves sources of pain and therefore a 
form of pain since their cessation or diminution leads to 
misery But the higher pleasures which we all experi¬ 
ence on rare occasions such as when surrounded by 
beautiful scenery or m the presence of a beautiful 
painting or sculpture, being not tinged with individuality, 
partake of the nature of that inconceivable bliss which 
the emancipated both here and hereafter, ever experience 
Prof Beussen in his “ Elements of Metaphysics * says 
* that positive delight of Aesthetic contemplation is to 
ns a warrant that beyond individuality there is not a 
painless nothing but a state the exuberant bliss of which 
saunot be compared to any earthly feeling of delight 1

reaction of the intellectual forms upon the thronging 
affections is actually in each moment limited to a narrow 
circle of ideas , but potentially, it constitutes the whole 
aggregate of empirical reality, this itself being nothing 
more than the consciousness (accompanying all my

that which actually is represented

244 (An opponent now says) “ Duality is 
opposed to non-duality and therefore while 
there is a manifestation of duality, how can you 
establish your non-duahty 7 Consciousness is 
obviously not opposed to duality and so my 
position is stronger than yours ”

245 (To this the Vedantm replies) “ If 
it is so, your duality being a product of Maya, 
has no real existence Therefore the only true 
reamaimng thing is non duality which is 

manifested ” 

Consciousness which is the element of unity in us 
is really opposed to all duality but only things of the 



22d 


same grade of reality can act upon each othei There 
fore this duality which is the result of illusion can be 
destroyed only by a notion of its falsity and the notion 
and the duality must be of the same grade According 
to Yedanta there aie three grades of reality, the highest 
pertaining to Brahman (called Panmarthika Sattal, the 

second being the experience of the wak* ful state and the 
third the experience of the dreamy state and of the 
illusions of the wakeful state It is evident that a tiger 
which one meets with m a dream can be killed only 
with a spear seen in the dream also Any number of 
spears lying by the side of the dreamer, although they 
belong to a higher grade of reality , can never help him m 
an encounter with the tiger in the dream Similarly 
Puie Consciousness or Brahman which is the highest 
reality can never affect anything else because in the 
light of Brahman there can be nothing else for if it were 
able to affeot anything else, there would be a relation 
established between them which again would lead to 
duality So the argument is not valid

244 


discrimination which is begmmngless is said to be Avidya 
or primal nescience This nescience has two phases 
Vikshepa or the power of manifestation and Avarana or 
the power of concealment The latter is the cause of 
one s saying that Kootastha does not exist and is not 
manifested Commonlj people admit their ignorance 
and also their being conscious of it Therefore the 
co existence of Consciousness as Kootastha and of 


nescience is not incompatible Vikshepa is the super- 
impositon of egoiby with gross and subtle bodies on 
Kootastha covered by nescience, like the superimposition 
of silver on mother of pearl The ideas of * self and 
* entity belonging to Kootastha are referred to the ego 
and the unassociatedness and blissfulness of Kootastha 
become veiled In the universal usage of the word 
1 self there is a linguistic evidence of an instinctive 
lecognttion on the part of man of a something existing 
beyond the ego and the objects of perception as their 
basis The veiling power (Avarana) and mutual 
supenmposi tion (VikshepaJ which are the products of 
nescience are destroyed by a knowledge of the Self 
The effects of the creative power viz, the phenomenal 


world, being the manifestation of the causes that have 
been operating during a series of births, can end only 
with the exhaustion of the particular Karma that has 


already begun to fructify in this life According to the 
theory of Karma, everj one starts his life with a store 


of karma at his credit, a portion of which begins to 
A-untifv in that life, the rest accompanying him through 



all the future births, determining their character till he 
realises Brahman When enlightenment comes, while 
that portion of the karma which has already begun to 
fructify will have to be completely exhausted m that 
life, the rest of the store will disappear without ever 
going through the process of fructification This is 
not in conflict with the theory of causality, as no cause 
oan operate in the presence of an obstacle and enlighten¬ 
ment being the most powerful of such obstacles, the 
unexhausted atoie of karma cannot in its presence ever 
operate This is the exoteric view 

Numeious sects try to establish an Iswara to suit 
their own particular predelictions (vide stanzas 60 ] 19) 
bub as declared in the Vedas, Iswara is onlj Atma 
associated with Maya and the whole Universe is pervaded 
by animate and inanimate objects which are parts of 
that Iswara From this point of view the worship of 
any object becomes reconcilable wifcb Vedic teachings 
This Maya is of the nature of nescience as testified to 
by universal experience The sphere of intellect is 
circumscribed by Maya Every fact of phenomenal 
experience can be connected with its cause only up to 
a certain point beyond which every one is bound to 
confess his ignorance Maya thus sets a limit to the 
enquiry into the causes of things It is absurd to 
enquire into the cause of Maya or Avidya , for the 
sphere of intellect being limited in all directions by 
ignorance, the notion of a cause which is derived from 



246 


intellectual experience and is therefore legitimately 
restricted to it cannot overstep the bounds of the 
intellect itself This Maya or Avidya is admittedly 
experienced In all people Therefore from the point of 
view of unenlightened people, it must be presumed to 
exist It is not of the natuie of existence such as 


Brahman, nor of non-existence like a barren woman's 
son Therefore fiom the point of view of reason it must 
be said to be indefinable As Maya and its effects are 
destroyed bj true knowledge its real existence cannot be 
predicated Therefore from the point of view of know 
ledge, it must be said to be unreal This Maya makes 
the unchanging and unattached Atma assume the form 
of the Universe It creates Jiras and Iswara through a 
inflection of Atma m itself (Maja) Since what is not 
attached can never become attached, the action of Ma>a 
in making it seem so is all the more wonderful In fact 
it is impossible and hence unreal Maya is commonly 
understood to be that which bemg plainly visible is at 
the same time incapable of exact determination as to its 
nature This world is elearlj manifested but it is 
impossible to define its exact nature Every one under 
taking to determine the nature of this world is con 
fronted at every step with ignorance (Maja^ The mo«t 
modern theories of Cosmic evolution are no better in this 


respect Evolutionists posit an original nebulous condi 
tion from which the whole of the present state of things 


is supposed to have gradually developed The notion of 
gas in an incandesent condition militates against every 



247 


possibility of living germs, The problem as to how life 
can have originated ever remains unsolved The 
Scientists will have to take refuge m a supplementary 
dogma of spontaneous generation of life an altogether 
meaningless expression and a doctrine opposed to every 
day experience Even if it is possible to prove the origin 
of life from not-life, the introduction of the new element 
of consciousness which in its nature is diametrically 
opposed to all matter must remain an inexplicable 

enigma From the Ps\ chological point of view, it ib 
impossible to establish any genetic relations between 

the subject l, conscious ness) and object (matter) There¬ 
fore things that are unthinkable should not be subjected 
to canons of logic and we are bound to believe Maya or 
nescience to be the cause of this unthinkable universe 

This Maya is experienced by everybody in dreamless 
sleep One that wakes from deep sleep remembers having 
experienced the sole existence of blissful self and even 
his declaration of ignorance is necessarily couched m 
the language of the intellect It is only by contrast to 
this world that he now perceives, that he talks of its 
non-perception during sleep The creatton and destruc 
^tion of the universe mean, becoming manifest and remai 
mng unmanifest as in the wakeful and Bleeping states 
respectively Brahmic consciousness associated with 
Ma> a is Iswara and all things from Brahma (the creator) 
down to a blade of grass m the universe are manifesta¬ 
tions of Iswara All these when worshipped as Iswara 
yield rewards the degree of which depends upon tho 



248 


conception of the attributes of the object worshipped and 
the method of worship Just as a dream does not end 
unless the dieamer gets into the waking state, so final 
emancipation can never be obtained unless one comes 
to know tbe real nature of Brahman Therefore those 
desirous of emancipation should not waste time m 
enquiring into a variety of disputes concerning the 
nature of lelation of Iswara and Jiva who are the 
products of Maya and who in turn create the whole 
visible world When the knowledge of the real entity 
of the secondless Brahman arises the whole universe 
composed of animate and inanimate nature created by 
Iswara and Jiva comes to be looked upon as unreal as a 
dream From this it should not be concluded that tbe 


Vedantin is a pessimist Tbe kind of pleasures ana 
pains that are condemned by Vedanta as leading to 
bondage are only such as spring from egoity Besides 
positive pain in this life which every one would like to 
avoid, the pleasures which appear as such, onlj when 
restricted to individual experience, are themselves 
sources of pam since their cessation or diminution leads 
to misery But the higher pleasures which wo all 
experience when surrounded by beautiful scenery or in 
the presence of a beautiful painting or sculpture, being 
not tinged with individuality partake of that mconceiv 


able bliss which the emancipated both here and here 


after ever experience 
‘Elements of Metaphysics 


Professor Deussen m his 
says "that positive delight 


of aesthetic contemplation is to us a warrant that 



249 


beyond individuality there is not a painless nothing but 
a state the exuberant bliss of which cannot be compared 
to any earthly feeling of delight * 

An enlightened man and an unenlightened one may 
both be engaged in worldly concerns but the latter does 
so with a firm conviction of the reality of happiness and 
misery of this world and of the next and is consequently 
bound, whereas the formei does bo with an entirely 
different conviction and is therefore free The argument 

that nonduality cannot be established, as we are conscious 
of manifested duality, is not valid because duality being 
the product of Maya has no real existence Conscious 
ness which is the element of unity in us is really 
opposed to all duality but only things of the same giade 
of reality can act upon each other Therefore this 
duality which is the result of illusion can be destroyed 
onlj with a notion of its falsity, and the notion and the 
duality must be of the same grade According to 
Vedanta, there are three grades of reaht>, ihe highest 
pertaining to Brahman called Paranaarthikaaatfca, the 
second being the experience of the wakeful state and the 
third the expenence of the dreamy state and ot the 
illusions oE the wakeful state It is evident that a tiger 
which one meets in a dream can be killed only with a 
Bpear seen in the dream also Any number of spears 
lying by the side of the dreamer although they belong 
to a higher grade of reality can never help him in an en 
counter with the tiger in a dream Similaily pure 



250 


consciousness or Brahman which is the highest reality 
can never affect anything else, because m the light of 
Brahman there can be nothing else, for if it were able 
to affect anything else, there would be a relation esta 
bhshed between them which again would lead to duality 
Therefore, all the universe being the product of unthmk 

able Maya, what remains is non duality The non dual 
self is the only absolute reality, since as Consciousness it 
is timeless while the manifestation of the world is only 
contingent on the existence of a perceiving subject 
Hence the world cannot claim the same kind of reality 
as the self Consciousness is eternal as its non existence 
can never be experienced, but the non existence of 
duality before its manifestation is experienced by 
Consciousness as m dreamless sleep 

4n enlightened man identifying himself with the 
changeless Consciousness and having overcome egoity 
will not feel pleasure or pain on account of any change 
of condition m his body in other words he comes to 
look upon his body as alien to himself as we look upon 
i tree or other object of perception 

Desirelessness, knowledge and abstention from 
lotions generally help each other in bringing about 
emancipation Of these, knowledge is the most essential 
being directly conducive to emancipation, tbe other two 
are helpful accessories, as in the absence of knowledge

one to be reborn in a superior world or station of life

A person who has complete knowledge without the other

to be undergoing misery due to the commencement of

by drugs and bodily practices altogether reprehensible 
in the eye of the Vedantm Enlightened people may be 
have differently in accordance with the differences of 
their karma which is developing into action But their 

knowledge is one and therefore their emancipation is 
also one Just as a picture is drawn on a canvas so the

5 The unchangeable, unattached Brahman 
of the nature of pure consciousness is the basis 
for superimposition (of body, sensory organs 
&c) When through mutual superimposition* 
he is taken to be associated with intellect, with 
which he has no real connection, he becomes 
Jiva and is known as Purusha (in the 1st 
stanza)

Kootastha, becomes the agent in seeking emancip¬

without a basis is inconceivable 

7 When Jiva having the basis of un¬ 
changeable Kootastha, wiongly identifies himself 
with the gross and subtle bodies, he comes to 
think of himself as bound by the pleasures and 
pains of this world

(i e, the bodies &c) the basis attains to its 
natural predominance He then feels himself to 
be of-the nature of pure consciousness and un¬

18 Therefore Vedas say that Cludabhasa 
who is associated with Kootastha and known by

21 (If you object) that by the word ‘that’

fcbe opposite bank wished to ascertain whether all of 
them had safeh crossed Now each began to count the 
lest omitting himself, and found that they were only 
nine They therefore began to bemoan the supposed loss 
of the IQfch person An intelligent wayfarer being made 
acquainted with their condition, informed them that all 
the ten were safe and that none was lost But as they 
could not be convinced, he began to whip each on the 
back, counting the numbers at the same time, till at last 
when he came to the tenth person he laid the whip 
sharp on his back saying ‘thou art the tenth This is

38 Ignorance and envelopment are clearly 
prior to superimposition and though Chidabhasa 
i*> the result of bupenmposition, the first two 

conditions must be attributed to Chidabhasa and 
not to Kootabtha 


As Koofcisfcba is unattached nothing can be 
attributed to him but only to Chidabhasa To the cause 
seeking intellect, one appears to succeed the other but 
all the three factors as in the case oi Kantian functions 
of tbe mind, ought to be supposed to come into play 
simultaneously 






ii ii 


39 As the germs of superimposition exist 
even before its origin, therefore there is nothing 
wrong in attributing the first two conditions to 
Chidabhasa alone (See note to the previous 

stanza) 

rtflWKlfaaBR TOraW 5T*T I 

* q gtf Nr srsrrar n *o n 

40 It should not be objected that these two 
conditions can be attributed to Brahman, as they 


267 


are superimposed on him, because the Brahman 
is the basis on which all states are superimposed 

As they are all alike unreal, they cannot have 
a real relation to Brahman In this stanza Brahman 
and Kootastha are used synonymously

41 It will be admitted that it is only Jna 
that has the right to say “I am engaged in 
worldly concerns”, “I have knowledge”, “I am 

free from sorrow”, and “I am happy” There¬ 
fore the last four stages can be attributed only 
to Jiva and not to Brahman 

sfhftss srsraTSwra * fi[ i

42 Similarly the two stages preceding 
superimposition must by a parity of reasoning 
be attnbuted to Jiva who says “I am ignorant”, 
“There is no Kootastha and he is not mani¬ 
fested” 

5T^rfasT?i<nir i

43 The ancient teachers spoke of Brahman 
as being the basis on which the various stages 
are superimposed We attribute these stages to 
Jiva as he identifies himself with ignorance and 
says that he experiences it

44 When through indirect and direct 
cognition, ignorance is dispelled, the results of 
its envelopment tint Kootastha does not exist 
and that he is not manifested also disappear 

sroMTfratssr II ii 

45 Through indirect cognition, the result 
of envelopment that Kootastha does not exist, 
is destroyed Through direct cognition, the 
other result of envelopment that Kootastha is 

not manifested is destroyed 

46 Consequently the superimposed idea 



of Jiva vanishes and all sorrow resulting from 
being engaged in worldly concerns and from the 
idea of being the actor &c disappears 

?rr 3* 11 « « u 

47 From the destruction of pains and 

pleasures, from experiencing the feeling of being 

emancipated and from the absence of fresh 

sources of sorrow, untrammelled happiness 
arises

48 The scriptural verse quoted at the 
beginning of this section, refer* to the two 
conditions of direct cognition of Brahman and 
desti notion of sorrow as being related to Jiva 




49 The dnect cognition of Biah 


lan 


1 eferred to as ‘that’ in the above verse, is of two 



kinds, as Atma is self luminous md is perceived 
as such by the intellect 

srm snr n \o u 

50 As even in indirect cognition, the fact 
that the self-luminous Brahman exists, is cognised 
by the intellect, the self luminosity of Brahman 
remains the -arae (oi foi the mattei of that, it is 
not iffected by even the grossest ignorance)

51 Indirect knowledge bv which one does 
not know U I am Brahman” but that Brahman 
exists, is not wiong knowledge, as it is not 
contradicted by the succeeding stage 

?r?r gqq; i

52 If there had been evidence that there 
was no Brahman, then this indirect knowledge 
would be capable of refutation As we know of 



271 


no *uch strong evidence, this is not refuted 

•srir?cT ir\*ii 

53 Indirect knowledge cannot be illusive 
simply because one cannot conceive the higher 
reality Simply because one cannot conceive 
heaven, an induect knowledge that heaven exists 
is not illusory 

The pith of the argument used here is that the 
inconceivability of anything is no argument against its 
existence for as John Stuart Mill says, the sphericity 
of the earth was disputed by the opponents of Columbus 
on the ground that it was inconceivable how people in 

the antipodes could walk erect with then feet towards 

ours 

a4 The indirect cognition of Brahman 

who is fit to be cognised only directly cannot be 
illusory For even in indirect cognition Brahman 

is not comprehended as the object of indirect 
cognition and our inability to cognise him 



272 


directly is due to his nature being not descnb 
able as such or such 

T^rw^rfa ^n5R«r B?rre?rMMT^r n ii 

55 It cannot be said that because Brahman 
cannot be known as a whole, the indirect cogni¬ 
tion must necessarily be false for in that case our 
knowledge of a pot must also be false as we can 
not know it as a whole at once Though Brahman 
is really without parts, we have to assume it as 
made up of two parts, the ignorance about which 
has to be got rid of

56 By indirect cognition we get rid of 
that portion of ignorance fay which we say that 
there is no Brahman By direct cognition we get

that Brahman is not manifested

67 In the example made use of above, 
the knowledge that the tenth person is alive is 
indirect knowledge and is bj no means false 
Similarly indirect knowledge that Brahman is, is 
also true In both cases, the envelopment of 
ignorance is similm

58 Just as the tenth person realises hi 
self to be the tenth person, so by a propel study 
of the sacred text “Self is Brahman”, the direct 

cognition arises that the enquirer himself is 
Brah man

59 The answer to the question as to who 
the tenth person is, is brought home to the 
questioner by his counting himselE along with 


the others and when he comes to his own tui n 
knows himself to be the tenth

60 The knowledge that himself is the 
tenth person can never be destroyed, even though 
he may be placed at the beginning, middle or 
end of the other nine A doubt as to whether 
he is the tenth or not never arises 

This is translated in accordance with the views 
of the commentator The author himself makes no 
explicit reference to the mistake arising from the order 
of counting We are of opinion that the expression 
“in the beginning, middle or end * refers rather to the 
period antecedent to the origination of the mistake and 
to the middle and end of the same After knowledge 
has lighted upon the tenth person, he would never 
doubt that he was the tenth either before the mistake 
arose 01 when it continued or after it was corrected 
That is to say the mistake was one of fancy and not of 
fact This explanation fits in with the doctrine of 
Brahman, viz , that when the enquirer becomes enhghte 
ned he will never doubt his oneness with Brahman 
either before enquiry or during enquny or at the 
moment of enlightenment His feeling would be “I 
was Brahman, I continued to be Brahman, I am 
Brahman and shall continue to be such * 

61 After indirectly cognising the exist 



275 


ence of Brahman from such holy texts as “Befoie

ledge on account of his associate and that 
Brahman who has no associate cannot become 
the subject of direct knowledge

cannot be said to be altogether unassociated, as 
long as he is the object of knowledge , this will 
cease to be only when Jiva obtain*-* emancipa¬ 
tion with destruction of body 

The author is ver> fond of insisting upon the 
persistence through life of t»he associate bodv and its 
affections by the force of fructifying Karma, even after 
a man has become enlightened But this is only an 
exoteric doctrine In tiufch, with the dawn of know- 
ledge all nescience and with it the whole train of its 
effects including the gross subtle and causal bodies, even 
tbe percepts, must vanish This is supported b\ Verse

doctrine of Prarabdba, yet that si^ch is not his real view 
is seen from Viveka Chudamam and Aparokshanubhuti 



Indeed without such a result Advaita will defeat its own 
purpose A popular waj of exploding the exoteric 
doctrine above referred to, is by asking how one of the 
wives of a man who had married three could remain a 
Suvasmi (a woman with husband alive) after the other 
two had become widows by his death The three wives 
referred to mean the three kinds of Karma, Agami,

So The onl\ difference between Jiva and 
Brahman consists in the respective presence and 
absence of the associate internal organ There 
is no other difference 


The distinction between Jiva and Brahman 
owes its existence only to the operations of the intellect 
The following verse translated from the fourth chapter 
of Bbagavata points to the same thing 1 " Just as the 
distinction between an object and its reflection continues 
only so long as there are reflecting media e g , water, 
mirror <tc, so also one sees the distinction between the 
self and the non self or between the individual self and 
the supreme self, onl\ so long as the medium of 
nescience (intellect) exists and not otherwise V

absence is an associate in the case ot Brahman 
Just as, it does not mattei whethei handcuffs 
aie made ot steel or gold, both serve the purpose 
of restraining the movements of the hands 

The associate heie lefeired to acts as an

because of the absence of the same on the part of

abbasa whose basis Kootastba is is neither necessary

the primal ignorance be removed but egoism must come

103 During numberless prior births, Jiva

105 It is such worship of Iswara that is 
dealt with m the Vedantic works If one has 
not acquired the power of concentration prior to 
initiation into Brahmic truths, he will subse¬ 
quently obtain it by continued meditation on 

Brahman 

The meaning of the stanzas 104 & 105 may 
be summed up thus By mere development of con 

centration of mind, one can get rid of the notion of 
the body being the self and of the world being 
real Worship of Iswara (i e , meditation of Brahman 
with attributes) as necessitating concentration will 
produce these results The Upasana (i e , meditation of 
one thing as another e g , the sun or mind as Brahman) 
portion of Upamshads abounds with methods of con 
centration But every Vedantic student need not 
necessarily go through Upasana praotiqe as be can a ko 
attain to tbe result, viz, concentration by direct 
meditation on the attnbuteless Brahman

107 The bold seeker after truth should, 
after acquiring proper knowledge, always fix his 
attention on it No word that does not connote 
Brahman should occupy his mind as that would

referring to the nature of Brahman, for that would be

of meditation, viz one thinking on God as non distinct

158 From the questions of Arjuna and

one has to experience the results of fructifying 
Karma in spite of the absence of desire on one’s 


part to enjoy them

It appears at first sight that the Lord s answei 

is beside the question for Arjuna’s enquiry implies that 
he supposes some one other than himself to bo the cause 
of his smful conduct and the Lord m reply simph refers 
to desire and anger to be the causes Thereby be 
implies that the cause of one s sinful conduct, is to be 
sought for in one s own internal tendencies only That 
desire and anger are at the loot of all evil is clear from 

the fact that one desiring for external things grants 
their reality and theieby subjects himself to all the 

pernicious consequences of the original error Similarly 
no one can possibly be angry with another unless be 
believes him to be distinct from one s self, a belief again 
based on primeval ignorance

223 The body is of three kinds, the gross,

to the three bodies 

224 The gross body is subject to crores 
of diseases arising from flatulence, biliousness

227 These various aftections are said to 
"be natural to the three bodies IE free from

SUMMARY OF CH4PTER VII 


In this chapter is given the explanation in detail of 
the Vedic passage “ When a person (Purusha) comes to 
realise his own self to be * that tParabrabman), 
wishing what and to satisfy whose desire, can he be 
swayed by any affection m bis bod> ? Intellect, sensor} 
organs, body &c , are superimposed b} Maja on Brahman 
When Brahman is taken to be associated with intellect 
&c t with which he has no real connection, he becomes 
Jiva or Chidabhasa (Consciousness reflected through or 
associated with intellect^ and is known as Purusha 
When Jiva (or Purusha) based on the unchanging 
Kootastba (Brahmic Consciousness, the basis for the 
superimposition of intellect, body <fcc ,) identifies himself 
with the gross and subtle bodies, he comes to think of 
himself as bound by the pleasures and pains of this 
world When Purusha discards the illusory portion, 

(i e intellect bod} »tc,) tho basi6 attains to its natural 

predominance Ho then feols himself to be of the 
nature of pure Consciousness and unattached Oncol 
the strong objections raised against Achnita is, that 
since e\er\ thing other than Brahman is false, e\cn the 

judgments of the mind supporting tho ad\aitic astern 

e g t ‘Jam Brahman * must tbemfohes bo fnho Hor 
can a conviction based on such a judgment lend tonn\ 



361 


desirable result* The answer h that* any falsity even 
of the operations of mind proves the necessity of a real 
substratum which in the case of Vedanta is Brahman 
And since mental activity presupposes differentiation of 
subject from object, the falsity of mental judgments 
does not affect the secondless Brahman Moreover it is 
not true that such a conviction does not lead to any 
result for although false from a higher point of view, it 
will be valid so long as dualietic illusion lasts and it will 
enable one to overcome the pleasures and pains 
incidental to dualism The nature of the evil and its 
remedy will have to be of the same grade of reality as 
stated in the previous chapter When a person gets as 
firm a conviction that he is Brahman, as an 
ordinary mats has when identifying himself with bis 
body, then that man necessarily gets emancipation 
whether he likes it or not The seven different stages 
consisting of ignorance, envelopment, supenmposition, 
indirect cognition, direct cognition, cessation of sorrow 
and generation of satisfaction are to be considered 
in relation to \tma The reflected Consciousness 
(ChidabhftSft or PurustW being always engaged in 
wordl> concerns does not know himself to be the self- 
luminous Kootasthn, This is ignorance and the first 
stage of evolution His saying that there is no Kootae- 
tha and that lie is not manifest, is the result of envelop 

ment ( Parana) the second stage His saying that he 
is tho agent and the enjo>er is the result of superimpo 

eition (viksbepal the third stage From the words oi a 



362 


teacher, he first comes to have an indirect cognition 

of the existence of Kootastha This is the fourth stage 

Afterwards through a course of reasoning and enquiry 

he comes to hate a direct cognition that he himself is 

Kootastha This is the fifth stage Then he begins to 

gne up the ideas that be is the actor and the onjojer 

whioh aie the sources of sorrow This is the sixth 

stage Finally he is happ} that all that has to bo 

done has been done and that all that bis to be obtained 

has been obtained This is the seventh stage The 

first three are the causes of bondage to Purusha or 

Cfaidabhasa or Ji\a As Kootastha is unattached* 

nothing can be attributed to him but onl> to Jh a To 
the cause seeking intellect, one appears to succeed tho 

other but all these stages as in the case of Kantian 
functions of the mind ought to be supposed to come into 
play simultaneous!} *Ve attnbute these stages to 
Parasha as he identifies himself with nescience and sa>« 
that be experiences it W hen through indireet and 
djrect cognition the results of its onrelopmont that 
Kootastha does nob exist nud that bo is not manifested, 
respectfi el> disappeui Then the superimposed idea of 
Tiva or Purushn, \ aniahes and all sorrow resulting from 
being engaged in wordl} concerns and from the idea of 
being fcbo actor and tho enjoyor disappears Untrnmollcd 
happiness arises from the destruction of pains and 
pleasures from experiencing tho feeling of being 
emancipated and from the absence of fresh sources of 
sorrow Tho indirect knowledge by xvhioh one dors not 



363 


know “I am Brahman but that Brahman exists, is not 
wi ong knowledge as it is not contradicted by the sue 
ceeding stage Indireot knowledge cannot be illusive 
simply because one cannot conceive the higher reality 
In other woids, the mere inconceivability of anything is 
no argument against its existence, for instance the 
sphericity of the earth is a fact, though many cannot 
conceive how people m the Antipodes could walk 
eiect with their feet towards ours By a proper 
study of the sacred texts eg, 11 Self is Brahman* 

1 That thou art &c, direct cognition arises that the 
enquirer himself is Brahman When the enquirer 
thus becomes enhghtend he will never doubt his 
oneness with Brahman, either before enquiry 
oi during enquirv oi at the moment of enlighte* 
menfc Hib feeling would be M I was Brahman' and 
shall continue to be such The only difference between 

In a (Purusha) and Brahman consists in the respective 

piesence and absence of the associate internal organ 
(nund intellect &c) In ofchei words the distinction 
between Jn a and Brahman owes its existence onl> to 
the operations of the intellect Just as the presence of 
the associate, the internal organ in the Jiva is an 
obstacle to the knowledge of identity so its absence as 
sii associate in the case of Brahman , 8 an obstacle 
That is to si} the associate here ieferr e a to aots as an 
obstaclo to a man’s enlightenment both because he is 
bound down by the imperfections of the intellect ana 
because of the absence of the same on the part of 



364 


Brahman In the Atma of the nature of Consciousness 
which remains after giving up the internal organ, one 
recognises Biabman as the internal witness in accordance 
with the saying “I am Brahman The internal witness

identity of the individual self (Jiva) with Brahman 



36b 


During numberless prior births, Jiva has allowed 
bis mind to indulge m the notion of the body being Atma 

and of the reality of the world Hence through force 
of habit as it were, the same wiong notion spontaneous)* 
appeals evei) moment Bj mere development of 
concentration of mind one can get rid oi the notion oi 
the body being the self and of the woild being real 
Worship of Iswara U e,) meditation of Brahman with 
attributes, as necessitating concentration will produce 
these results The Upasaua portion fi e ) the medita 
tion of one thing as another e g, the sun or mind as 
Biabman) of the Up&msh&ds abounds with methods of 
concentration But every Vedantic student need not 
necessarily go through Bpasana practice as he can also 
attain to the result viz concentration, by direct medita 
tion on the attnbufceless Brahman Meditation on Brab 
man consists m one constantly fchtnkiog on Brahman, 
speaking of Brahman, enlightening another on the nature 
of Brahman and thinking of nothing else No word that 

does not connote Brahman should occopv bis mind rs 
that would be mere waste of energy Neither should be 
jn speech use words not referring to the nature of 
Brahman, for that would be waste of breath Gita also 
says “To those whose minds aie ever fixed on me and 
who worship me as non-distmot from their own self, 

I grant the accomplishment of all desires and the 

preservation of everything gamed 

A possible objection may be taken to this kind of 
meditation viz, one thinking on God as non dwtmet from 



367 


one s own self and yet making him the object of thought, 
That in all meditation, both subject and object should 
gradually dissolve into the secondless Brahman is the 
aim of all Ve dan tic practice Brihadaranyaka Upamshad 
(1— i— iO) says “He who meditates upon a deity as 
distinct from himself is not enlightened and is ignorant 

as a cow Sri Krishna also says in Mahabharata "Who 
evei 0 \rjuna, wishing to piaise me by reciting my 
thousand names, knows himself to be identical with me, 

his praise I accept even if he recites one verse ’ In the 
matter of practice of mental concentration, on the 
distinction between Atma and the body and the unreality 
of the world, there are no regulations as to how it is to 
be done, because it is a thing directly to be expeneneed 
As the mind is so fickle and cannot be forcibly controlled, 
let it be indulged m listening to the stories relating to 
the nature of Brahman Thus a right train of Brahmic 
ideas will be formed instead of the unreal train of worldly 
associations formed by employing oneself in agriculture, 
commerce, sersice &c or by a study of literary workB, 
logic or other branches of learning But one practicing 
concentration of mind, may be engaged in such acts as 
taking food &,c , as thej do not cause much distraction 
of mind and the thought "I am Brahman’ may very 
soon bo remembered even when momentarily forgotten 
Trul} enlightened men may be engaged m worldly 
concerns proper to them with the object of allowing the 

fructifying Karma, to exhaust itself Such people sbonia 
not be judged from the standpoint of the rn ] e8 and 



368 


prohibitions enjoined in scriptures Experiencing the 
effects of fructifying Karma is common to the enlighten 
ed and the unenlightened The former bears his lot 
without feeling pain but the latter loses heart and is 
bound down bv sorrow The one who has realised 
Brahman is not troubled with the erroneous notion of 
his body being Atma Therefore as the Yedic passage 
says “Wishing what and to gratify whom will he 
be swaved by any affections of his body ? From having 
a film conviction of the unreality of the world there is 
neither desire nor desirer In the absence of both these 
all pain arising from unsatisfied desire will cease 

Fructifying Karma is of the three kinds, that which 
produces desires, that which gives rise to enjoyment in 
the absence of desire and that which gnes rise to enjo) 
menb through the desire of another Sn Krishna says 
‘ Even wise men follow the dictates of their own nature 
All beings do likewise What can restraint do? ’ This 
is not meant to encourage fatalism as the entire power 
lessness under the influence of Karma refers to the un 
enlightened in the first instance and figuratnely to the 
enlightened It is onlv an exoteric doctrine that insists 
on the persistence through life of the associate body and 
its affections by the force of fructifying Karma, eten 
after a man has become enlightened In truth with the 
dawn of knowledge, all nescience and with it the whole 
tram of its effects including the gross, subtle and tbo 
causal bodies and even the percepts must vanish This

is supported tv verse 37 chnptei TV of Gita As the 
burmng fire induces fuel to ashes, 0 Arjuna, so doth the 
fire of wisdom reduces all actions to ashes (i e ,) it renders 
them impotent" Though Sri Sankara in hie comment¬ 
ary on this stanza, seems to uphold the doctrine of 
"Prarahdha” yet that such is not his real view, is seen 
from a number ol verses in “Vive ^acbudatnam” and 
"Aparokshamibhuti ” Indeed without suoh a result

asking how one of the wives of a man who had mame< 
three could remain a Suvasmi (a woman with hei bus 
band alive) after the other two had become widows b} 
his death The three wives referred to are the three 
kinds of karma, Agatm, Sanchita, and Prarahdha 

To the question of Arjuna “ By what is a man 
impelled to commit sin even against his will and even 
as if ho were compelled by somebody to do so ?” Sri 
Krishna replies “ It is desire and anger produced by the 
quality of Bajas (activity) Know this which is all- 
consuming and all sinful to be our enemy here *' It 
appears at first sight that the Lord's answei is beside the 
question, for Arjuna s enquiry implies that he supposes 
some one other than himself to be the cause of his sinful 
conduot and the Lord m reply simply refers to desire 
and anger to be the causes Thereby he implies that

Jut as the enjoyer is the most central factoi, the lovo

hould give up attachment to external objects and turn 
uch love towards his Self and try to understand the 
nchanging Koot&stba One desirous of emancipation 
hould always be engaged in enquiry into the nature of 
le Self and come to know the Self better Differentiating 
ie nature of the enjoyer with the help of the law of the 
variable and the variable, a person convinces himself 
lat the invariable witness of the thiee states of waking* 
ream and dreamless sleep is really not attached to 
lything The experience of each of the states is 
sculiar to that state and does not occui m the other 
ates The experience (1 e,) witness remains the same 
. all When a person comes to realise bis oneness with 
.at Brahman which causes the worlds oi wakefulness, 
earn and sleep to appear, he becomes released from all 
indages The disappearance in deep sleep of Ohida 
iasa who is included in the umeal world tbe product 
Maya, is noted by the witness who undergoes no change 
iffcrentiating Gbidabbasa thus and knowing his liability 
destruction, one loses all desire for enjoyments and 
3 ls ashamed of taking part in worldly concerns as 
fore In the state of nescience one would feel with 
mplacence "I enjoy all this*' In the enlightened 
te on the contrary, ho would feel ashamed of even i 



373 


confessing to himself that he is the enjoy er because it 

would reduce him to the level of children playing with 

dolls When Ghidabhasa as well as the objects of 
enjoyment is known to be unreal, the enlightened man 

must be ashamed ol identifying himself with Chidabhasa 
Thus the words M for whose gratification ” m the scrip 
fcural verse under consideration, are intended to denote 
that in reality theie is no enjoyer at all and that con 
sequently to the enlightened there are no bodily miseries 
This is the true esoteric view of the Vedas as regards 
Prarabdha 

As there are three kinds of bodies, gross, 
subtle and causal, there are three kinds of miseries 
referring respectively to these three The gross body 
is subject to numeious diseases, malformations, hunger 
thirst and other sources of misery The affections of 
the subtle body are of two kinds (l) desire, anger eto, 
the presence of which causes misery and (2) control of 

mind and senses, the absence of which tends to 
produoe misery When the self je in the causal body 

as in the state of dreamless sleep, he is incapable of 
recognising either himself or others and remains as if 
dead This causal body is the seed of future births and 
consequent misery Although the existence of the 
three distinct bodies is not demonstrable, every one 
feels their effects in the form of defects noted above, 
So the man who aims at release though he cannot 
divest himself of the bodies directly, may endeavour to 
repress their effects, whereby the bodies themselves? will 



374 


disappear This is the piactical phase of Vedanta 
The bodies cannot last without their affections for as 
Prof Deussen says, the bodies are simply the affec 
tions objectified There is no affection natural to 

Cbidabhasa apart from those inhering m the bodies with 
which he seems to be associated, for it is a reflection of 
pure Consciousness or Kootastha whose only obaractens 
iic is self luminousness But all the same throuf 1, 
gnorance Chidabhasa thinks himself to be one with t) 
.hree bodies Superimposing the entity of wifcne 
kootastha on the three bodies associated with himse 
le thinks that they constitute his real nature Whi 
he illusion lasts, Chidabhasa superimposes the bodil 
,flections on himself and feels that he is affected b 
hem Differentiating himself and Kootastha from tb 
odies, rejecting all illusion and knowing himself to b 
, mere reflection of Kootastha and always thinking c 
be unchanging witness how can a person (i e ,) Chida 
hasa or Purusha or Jiva feel any misery at what raaj 
appen to the body? Chidabhasa then surrenders bn 
3 Dse of separateness and allows himself to be mergec 
1 Kootastha Being thus released there will bo nc 
tore falling into nescience, as with enlightment all 
me space and causahtv are got o\er The state ol 
mancipation during life does not consist in tbe 
bservance of any prescribed rules, but m a know 
idge of the reality underlying all things 

The satisfaction proceeding from the enjoyment of 



375 


i material objects is defective, inasmuch as it increases 
desires The satisfaction derived from true knowledge 
of Brahman is without any such defect as one feel9 that 
everything that has to be done has been done and what¬ 
ever has to be enjoyed has been enjoyed Thus all 
desires yi&YB/ been rooted out An enlightened man 
having no mo&jdesirfls, cannot be affected by the joys 
,aad sorrow^ caused by the objects of enjoyment 
Though he may continue to perceive the world, the per¬ 
cepts cannot affect his knowledge, as he has already got 
beyond the power of joy and sorrow As it is incumbent 
upon people to work either for heaven in which there is 
temporary bliss or for emancipation which is eternal 
bliss, it is but right for people not qualified for higher 
knowledge to be always engaged m performing works 
If an enlightened man happens to be in the midst of such 
poisons, be must do all actions by his body, mind and 
speech so as to be m accord with them If he is m the 
midst of those wishing to acquire true knowledge, he 

must condemn all actions and give them up also, to set an 

example to them and encourage them When praised 

or blamed bv ignorant men, an enlightened man does 

neither praise nor blame them m return but acta m such 

a wav as to awaken a knowledge of the real entity in 

them He should adopt the course of action which is 

likely to help the cognition of Brahman by the ignorant 

and there is nothing else for him to do He will be 

immersed m the sea of bliss and will ever experience 
bliss

4 The cognition oE an external object e g, 
a pot is due to the operation of the intellect 
which assumes the foim of the pot (Cf

based on Pure Consciousness (Brahman) the basis 
of the whole universe

5 The notion “This is a pot” is preceded 
by a condition of the intellect in which the

presence of the pot is not recognised The for- 
mei is the result of intellectual operation leading 
to individual perception The latter although a 
state of consciousness, does not take notice of the 
existence of a pot as such This is the difference 
between pure Consciousness and intellectual 

consciousness

cognition

42 If it be objected that the destructible

(the indestructible) Brahman, we saj no, for in 
spite of the element of incompatibility (which 
exists as long as Jiva lemains Jiva) there is a 
common basis for Jna and Biahman (when Jiva 
ceases to be such)

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VIII 


-o- 

In addition to pure Brahmic consciousness which 
is the basis of everything in the universe there is in all 
embodied beings a reflection of Consciousness m intellect 
The pure Consciousness which forms the basis of the 
individual is Kootastha and the same Consciousness 
which is reflected in the intellect of that individual is 
known as Chidabhasa or diva Kootastha is always un 
changing and is the witness of the intellect, its opera 
tions, the intervals between the intellectual operations 
and the periods when they are absent as in sleep, fain 
ting and enlightend reflection (Samadhi) In Vedantic 
works Kootastha is described as the Consciousness on 
which as basis, is superimposed tbe illusion of Chida 
bbasa united with body sense organs etc, and Brahman 
is described as the basis in which arises the illusion of 
the world In waking and dreaming states, cognition is 
possible only when the operations of the mtelleot are 
pervaded by Chidabbasa giving rise to the the idea of 
egoity Mere intellectual operations unpervaded bj 
Chidabhasa do not result in cognition Therefore the 
manifestation of an object is due to two forms of consoi 
ousness (1 e ,) Kootastha and Chidabhasa Logicians and 
others describe tbe pure Consciousness that is Kootastha, 
as knowledge accompanying cognition , in other words, 



403 


a notion having another notion for its object The 
knowledge “ this is a jar M is due to Ghidabhasa only and 
the knowledge “ I know the Jai' is due to Kootastha 
Chidabhasa should be differentiated from Rootastba m 
the body Chidabhasa is changeable as it experiences 
birth and destruction, while Kootastha is unchangeable 
and unchanging In spite of this element of incompati¬ 
bility which exists so long as Jiva remains as Jiva, 
theie is a common basis for Jiva and Brahman when 
Jiva ceases to be such Just as in the Yedio text w All 
(the universe) is Brahman * there is a basis common to 
Brahman and to this whole universe, so in the passage 
tl I am Brahman ’ there is a common basis for Jiva 
also When the whole universe is superimposed on 
Brahmic consciousness, it follows that Jiva who is only 
an infinitesimal portion of the universe is also supenm 
posed on Brahman On account of the difference in 
the limiting conditions (1 e ) the universe and a parti 
cular portion of it, there appears to be a diffeience bet 
ween the things denoted by the terms “that* and 
“ tboa (i e ,) Iswara and Jiva But in reality there is 
no different* as the underlying Consciousness is one 
As Chidabhasa combines in himself Consciousness the 
basis of reality, and activity the chracfcenatic of the 
intellect the unreal element, be is a product of illusion 
He who baa a discriminating knowledge of the real 
nature of mind, Chidabhasa etc, can be said to be the 
knower of truth and to be free from the fetters of 
Samsara. 



404 


Seeing that bondage and release are only products 
of nescience, such a question as u who is bound is idle, 
since by the very nature of the question, the questioner 
betray his own ignorance which itself is the cause of 
bondage In the real state of things there 18 no birth, 
no death, no one bound, no one studying the Vedantas 
no one desirous of emancipation and no one that is 
emancipated To enable one to realise the unspeakable 
and unthinkable Parana atm a, the sacred sonptures base 
their teachings on Jiva, Iswara, Universe <tc That is 
to say the exposition of an unknowable thing is given 
in the terms of the knowable

ed by a gem thinks it to be a gem and runs after 
it mother man seeing the rays of light from a 
lamp, thinks it to be a gem and runs after it 



406 


Though both are acting under the influence of 
mistaken notions, the results of their actions 
are different as the first man gets the gem and 
the second does not 


The inference is mistaken because the mere 
appearance of light does not warrant any conclusion as 
to its proceeding from either a lamp or a gem Hence 
the inference is based on insufficient data

12 Actions done under a mistaken notion 
may accidentally gi\e use to desired lesults just 
as the falling of a ripe fruit of a palm just when 
a ciow settled on it, is attributed to the crow 
All such notions m e said to be coi rect inferences 
from insufficient data 

13 A correct inference from insufficient 
data may give rise to a real reward so worship 
of the real nature ot Brahman may give rise to 
emancipation 



14 After first acquit ing an indirect know¬ 
ledge of the real nature of Brahman, described

m the Vedantas as partless and secondless Cons

15 Instead of realising Brahman directly 
as one’s own inner self, if one knows m a 
general way that there is Brahman, from a study 
of Sastras, just as one may form a conception 
of the form of Vishnu, it is said to be indirect

That is to aay what the scriptures declare is

The author may be right in attributing to the Vedas or 
external suggestion, the first attempt on the part of a 
man to dueot his thoughts inwards, as natural!) our 
senses always operate on external objects Of 'The 
self existent created the senses out going, therefore 
one sees outside and not the Atma within some w 
telhgent man with bis senses turned away from their

of knowledge

scuptures declaie, is established by reasoning based on 
one s own expenence We may attribute to the agency 
of the Vedas the first attempt on the part cf a man to 
direct his thoughts inwaids as naturally the senses 
operate on external objects In this sense, Vedas may 
he admitted to he the onl\ sources of knowledge 

Indirect knowledge may anse b\ the teachings of 
some teacher 01 other hut direct knowledge can never 



160 

arise that way No mysti initiation m the repetition 
of formulas will be of any use here It can arise only 

by a course of engunv into the nature of Brahman 
Want of faith is an obstacle to indirect knowledge but 
want of propei enquuy is the only obstacle to direct 
knowledge Enquiry should be repeated again and 
again till a direct knowledge is obtained If it is not 
got in this life it will come m the next birth We have 
the example of Vamadeva who as a result of the prac 
tice of enquiry, came to realise Brahman while tying in 
bis mother s womb The thtee obstacles that stand m 
the way of one s realising Brahman aie past present 
and future Past obstacles are attachment to objects in 
past times or prior births Present obstacles consist of 
attachment to objects of sense dulness of intellect, false 
logic, and wrongly thinking of oneself as the actor, 
enjoyer Ac Fubuie obstacles are lebirths The only 
way to overcome these obstacles is a persistent course 
of enquirv into the nature of Brahman possiblj con 

tinned through a series of incarnations A man of dull 

intellect or one who has no accessones for enquiry 
should be constantly engaged in the meditation of tbe 

attributeless Biahman If it is possible to know 
B rahm an as being be\ond the reach of speech and mind, 
it is also possible to meditate on Brahman as such B> 
making Brahman an object of meditation we no doubt 
invest him with some attributes But as long as these 
flo called attributes are mere indications by which 



46 t 

Brahmic nature is understood, Biahroan may be medita 
ted upon by sueb indications as Existence, Consciousness 
and Bliss One should constantly think of such indica 
tions of Brahman as would create in him an attachment 
to the object of meditation He should confciune to do 
so till his death \s meditnlion depends upon a peison s 
will he maj do it in one wai, or in another way or 

not do it at all One should therefore exeit to 
Weep up a continuity of mental process so that he may 
do it even during the dreaming state Though enjoying 
the fiuits of his fructifying deeds, a meditator, through 
force of habit will come to have his thoughts evei faxed 
on the object of meditation and pay little attention to 
worldly concerns But an enlightened man, knowing the 
world to he the product of Maya and the self to be of 

the nature of pure Consciousness can afford to be engaged 
in worldly affairs as they are not opposed to his true 
knowledge Worldly activities need not presuppose any 
reality on the part of the world or intellectual dulness 
on the part of the actor They onl> require means e g , 
mind, speech, bod\ and external objects The enlightened 
man cannot do away with these means and so there is 
nothing to pretent his taking part in worldly concerns 
Mtor having firmly determined the natuie of Atma once, 
the knower of truth can at will speak of it think of it 
and meditate on it A meditator should always be 
engaged in de\otional exorcises to keep up the notion 
that be is Brahman or Vishnu, since such a notion has 
originated from and can be kept up by the exeicises and

religious merit in their previous births, the 
deities presiding ovei an, ^un, fire, Indra, and 
death, considered themselves ns distinct from 


Bi llunan and consequently aie canymg on their 

respective duties m this existence through fear 
of Brahman 


Even death is represented as carrying on his 

duties not like one having absolute power but as one 

obediently carrying out the mandates of a higher power 

Ho brought upon himself this servitude on account of 

his error in Brnhmic conception viz , conceiving Brah 

man as distinct from hunseU The TJpamshads mean 

that those who identify themselves with Brahman get to 

a state far bey ona that of Yama, the Lord of death

world (giving rise to pleasure and p*un) En¬ 
deavours should be made to purify it It is an 
ancient truth pieseived as a secret that the mind 
assumes the forms it is engaged m perceiving 

In peiception it is the same mind that while 
remaining as the subject becomes simultaneously the 
object of perception Otherwise the problem of external 
perception is insoluble (Vide Deussen's Elements of 
Metaphysics) Hence an important corollary follows 
viz , a man first creates the objective world, then chooses 
a portion of it to engage his affection and then identifies 
their interests with his own, feeling pleasure and pain 
as their conditions change, though suoh changes should 
not, properly speaking, affect him

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER \I 


-o- 

All Srutis Stnntis and Puranas unite in pioclaim 
ing that the knowledge of Brahman means the destruc 
tion of all sorrow and attainment of bliss Bliss is ol 
three kinds, bliss of Brahman bliss of knowledge and 
bliss of objects 4s Taittireva Upanisbad says “All 
beings are born of bliss, are maintained in bliss and bo 
come latent ra bliss Therefore Brahman is bliss 
Before evolution, when there was not the triad of knower 
knowledge and known, there was only Brahman unlimited 
by space and time Similarly in the states of Samadhi 
(enlightened reflection), sleep, fainting etc, the tuad ib 
absent and the iTripartite, secondless Brahman alone is 
experienced Any happiness experienced m the wakeful 
and dreaming states when the triad is present, is encom 
passed by so much misery, that it is as good as misery 
Therefore there is no happiness in duality In dreamless 
sleep there is non duality and so there is no sorrow 
Bliss is nothing but absence of sorrow or misery 
Invalids when sleeping soundly are m a state of bliss 
In sleep, Jwa loses his individuality and becomes 
Brahman himself as there is a complete absence of 
duality 1 e, of worldly concerns due to mental opera 
tions It ib a matter of common experience for a man 
waking from deep sleep to say “I was happy and knew 



520 


nothiug As LGoollcction depends upon past experience 
we 1 »ft i that there was an c\pumiu of bli&s ind of 
ignoianco in sloop Tho oxptiunce of bliss of the over 
existing entit\ is duo to its self eonsoiou-m xs and 
depends upon no mstiumontalitj It is the sanio 
consciousness that loveals the ignoranco GOMiiug bliss 
When one wakes from shop ho itmcmbeis Immg 
experienced unqualified bliss duiing sleep Since all 

thiough tho wakeful stUi ho bthaws like out not 
knowing his blissful nituie as retoaled in sleep, be 
betrays bis ignorance 01 \vid>a which in its positue 

aspect bungs him face to face with this woild and in 
its negative aspect abolishes the woild altogothci dunug 
sleep Hence the expiossion of his oxpouoncc duiing 
sleep m the terms ‘ \ knew nothing must bo taken to 
point not to the existence of positive Avidya dining 
sleep but to the fact that tho man in his waking 
moments feels that ho was not conscious during hi* 
sloop, of the world which now sui rounds him 


Scriptures teach that the waking of a person 

from sleep >s duo to tho opoiation of tbo karmic offoels 
Being prompted bv thou past karma to think all sorts 
of miseries, all people gtadunfl} forgot tho Brahmin 
felicity m tho waking condition In tho state of wako

with 


41 Supreme bliss is for that Yogi whose mind is calm, 
whose passion is controlled who has become Brahman 
and who is sinless , thrt is, in whom there ib not tho 
Least particle of dualiu left Disconnection from union 

miser} is called Yoga This Yoga must be 

practiced with hnn conviction and steady thoughts 
The mind is (vntuallj) the external world giung rise to 
pleasure and pain In perception it is the same mind 
that while remaining as the subject becomes simultano 
ously the object of perception Otherwise the problem 
of external perception is tnsolvable, as Professor 
Deussen says in hts “Elements of Metaphysics” 
Hence we see that a man first creates the objective 
world, then chooses certain portions of it to engage his 
affection upon and then identifies their interest with his 
own, feeling pleasure and pain as their conditions 
ohange, though such changes should properly not affect 
him Mind is impure when filled with desires and 
passions and pure when fiee from them Therefore it 
alone is the cause of bondage when attached to objects 
and of release wheu there ib no attachment to objects 
Beal heroism consists m repressing the senses though 
they be in the height of their vigour, and in directing the 
mmd towards the self with a view to tasting 



522 

Brahmic bliss The man who leahsed Brahman will 
have his thoughts fixed on the supreme bliss even while 
engaged in worldly concerns giving rise to pleasure and 
pain, no less than when m a state of indifference The 
enlightened man will look upon the bliss of Brahman 
and the bliss derived from objects as one and the same 
When any misery overtakes a man who has both spirit 
ual and worldly experiences, it will not affect him in the 
same wav as it would have done before the dawn of 
knowledge 

What distinguishes an enlightened man from 
an ignorant one is that in neither the wakeful nor the 
dreamy state will he be reall> affected by pleasure and 
pain which would appear to overtake him as they over 

take others

Self for the benefit of dull persons 




SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XII 


-o- 

The bliss of Atom is specially intended to be taught 
to such persons as have a dull intellect and who are yet 
desirous of knowing truth about Brahman All things 
including wife, sons and wealth are loved not for their 
sakes but for the sake of Self Self is nevei loved for 
the sake of anything else Love for the Self is not the 
same as desire, for it exists in the absence and presence 
of desires Food, drink, wealth Ac, become objects of 
desire, masmuchas tbey are the means of causing bappi 
ness to the Self The Self cannot be considered to be a 
means of happiness as m that case who would be the 
enjoyer of happiness ? The quality of being the action 
and the agent cannot inhere in one and the same tiling 

Some affection may be felt for means of happiness 
and it may change from one object to another But the 
love for the Self is unlimited and can no\ct* shift to am 
thing else The Self cannot also be an object of indiffer 

ence like a bit of straw, for the Self that is to be regard 
ed with indifference is not diffeient like a bit of ‘dratf 
from tbe Self who is to regard it with indifference Self 
never becomes an object of hatred ns may be supposed 
m the case of those who expross a desire for death, for 
in such instances it is only the bod} that is desired to 



553 


be given up It is the Self that desires to give up the 
body and. bo the Self cannot be said to bate himself 
Thus one's Self is the dearest of all Some of the Scrip 
tural passages may at first appear bo teach the inferiority 
of Self (Atmu) to others e g son etc , but Afcma is used 
in a threefold sense, figurative, illusory and pnmarj , 
and m worldly affairs, according to the contest each of 
these becomes primary in turn and the others secondary 
In the primary self there is just some love and in objects 
other than the three kinds of self there is no love at all 
These objects are of two kinds, objeots to be disregarded 

and objects to he hated Any individual thing may come 
under any of the four heads of classification uz , the 
primary Self, the secondary self, objects to be disregar 
ded and objects to be hated, according to the effects it 
produces on one Therefore the Self is the dearest, 
objects of enjoyment dear and all other 'objects either of 
indifference or to be hated Therefore one should after 
proper enquiry grasp that real entity differentiated from 
the five sheaths and recognise the fundamental error of 
loving things other than the Self and give up attachment 
to them All mental operations are accompanied bv con 
sciousnesa but not alwaj a by bliss This is because to 
whatever facfcoi we pay attention at the tune, we can 
perceive only that, though the other is also present 
Moreover when Satwa G-una predominates, we see the 
non separability of bliss and consciousness, as Satwa is 
pure When Rajognna is active, the Satvic bliss is 
masked by Bajas which is impure 



554 


It cannot be said that Yoga is necessary for final 
emancipation, though by discrimination one may come 
to feel that the Self is fche*dearest Yoga is a means of 

Knowledge, just as much as discrimination of the five 
sheaths is Knowing that Yoga is impossible for some 
and attainment of knowledge impossible for others, Sn 
Krishna spoke of two paths for final release One who 
has realised that the Self is dearest has no desire for 
any objects of enjoyment and is always enjoying supreme 
bliss

uniform nature while the pioduct of force i*> 
MSible, before its ongin and after its destruction 
and as it undergoes no change and suffeis no 
destruction, tt is said to be the real entity

46 (To this we reply that) The notion of 
the real entity of the pot has been destroyed 
thereby , therefore the destruction of the notion 
of the real entity of the pot from a proper know - 
ledge of its substratum should be regarded as 
destruction and not the actual imperception of 
the pot

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XIII 


Taittereya Upamebad sajs that the whole world 
arises in bliss, is maintained in it and at last becomos 
merged in it Bliss is the matonal cause of the universe 
as cla> is of the pot Material cause is of throe kinds 
(1) cause giving risn to the appealanco of oliango with 
out any real change (2) cause giving rise to real change 
(3) one set of causes giving rise to quite different 
effects The last two w hich presuppoao space cannot 
be predicated of Brahmic bliss which is partlcss and 
therefore spaceless Illusno appealances eg, a ropo 
appearing as a snake or Akasa appearing ns domoshaped 
and blue, though it has no sbapo or coloui, may occur 
in impartite Brahman \ forci known as Maja nin' 
be said to create this objective world with Brahman n* 
base This divine force appears to bo of different kind* 
as it manifests \ariousl> in the form of actions, know 
ledge and desires Whenovor Brahman is revealed b> 
an operation of its force, the lattei becomes manifested 
That phaBo of Biahmio power which gives riso to consci 
ousness is manifested in the bodies of embodied beings 
When the eternal manifesting Brahman assumes the 
cognising power, it is said to be mind The mind ha * li 
perception of oxternal objects and of bondage aU ^ 
emancipation The Majic force is distinct from it* 



589 


product, the woild and from its basis Biahraan It is 
called force when it is invisible and m its visible condi 
tion 13 called the effect The product of force and the 
invisible force exist only one at a time, but that in 
which both these wbeie accompanies them as constant 
basis Products of foice though visible have no ical 
entity as they aie liable to origin and destruction 

"When the} originate they aie mere names ina ented by 
men As they are described in words, their entity is 

purely nominal -Vs they have no real entity, aie liable 
to destruction and are described by names, the nature 
and picpeities of visible products of power e g , a pot 
are unreal But as the substratum of tbe pot (t e,) 
clay remains unchanged and is not destroyed, it is said 
to have real entity The objection that tbe knowledge 
of entity of the substratum clay, does not destroy the 
idea of the pot, may be answered by saying that the 
notion of the real entity of the pot has been destroyed 
thereby and that the destruction of the notion of tbe 
isal entity of the pot from a pioper knowledge of its 
substratum, should he regarded as destruction and not 
the actual impel ception of the pot Therefore tbe 
knowledge that every thing other than substratum 
Brahman is unreal, is the means of emancipation to 
those who bold the doctrine of non duality Therefore 

one must fix m mind the unreality of all effeobs (1 e,) 
phenomena Just as by a knowledge of clay, we know 
all objects made of clay, so by knowing Brahman the 

whole phenomenal world is known Prior to creation,

the universe was in an unmamfested state and subse 
quently became manifested b} name and foim By the 
teim unmamfested is meant the indescribable power of 
Maya in Brahman In the innumerable products of 
force with different names and forms, are inherent the

The names and forms being subject to destruction are 
unreal With a direct knowledge of Brahman as eternal 
existence, consciousness and bh^s, names and forms 
come to be disregarded and the man becomes emanci

of Brahman, consists m meditation on Brahman, speal 
ing of it and enligb Gening others on the subject By an 
incessant practice, the worldly impressions become 
loosened in all ways and vanish The Mayic force of 
Brahman is like the force existing in sleep capable of 
creating and destroying impossible dreams e g wnlking 
m the air, the cutting off of one s own bead Ac More- 
over at the time that dreams occur, there is no question 
of the occurrences being proper or improper and 
whatever happens appears to be in its real place When 
such is the power of sleep, what is there to wonder at 
the unthinkable power of Maya Akasa, air, fire, water, 
earth, the universe, animate and inanimate things ate all 

products of Maya

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XIV 


-o- 

Bliss of knowledge is a modification of intellectual 
poration It is of foui kinds (l) absence of sorrow 
2 ) fulfilment of desires ( 3 ) satisfaction arising from 
ccomplishmont of all deeds that have to bo done, and 
i) realisation of atl that has to be loalised The illu 
ory identification of the supremo self with the gross, 

iibtle and causal bodies gives rise to object* of enjoy 
lent The onjoyer identifying himself with the body 
esiros objects of enjoyment foi his own gratification and 
auses misery to his three bodies The misenos 
Hooting the gross body are various diseases duo to the 
ifferenoes in the bodily temperament Desires and 
assions affect the subtle body and the seed of gross and 
ubtle bodies is m the causa! body One who has come 
3 loaliso tho Self by discriminating Self fiom non self 
00s not porceivc any real object of enjoyment and 
iorefore thoie is nothing left for him to desire Wbon 
30 Tiva is recognised in the unchangeable Kootastlm 
lore is no onjoyer and no 100m foi bodily affections 
nd hence follows absence of sorrow The knowor 
btains all desiros at onco and will at one and the same 
me enjoy all grades of bliss from tho bliss of an 
Imperor to that of Brahma the creator, as described in 
ic Taittoreya Upamshnd 'Moreover tho witno Q smg 



615 


Consciousness of tbe enlightened knower, looks upon all 
bodies as he does his own and therefore he may be said 
to enjoy the bliss of all the creatures When there is no 
sorrow and when all desires are fulfilled, there must 
follow the feeling of satisfaction that all that has to be 
done has been done No Vedic injunctions or prohibi 
tions can bind the knower as he has risen superior to 

them all Whatever he may be seen to be doing is 
merely due to the fructifying karma which is exhausting 
itself By realising Brahman, the knower has realised 
all that has to be realised and there is nothing left for 
him to accomplish

SUMMARY OP CHAPTER XV 


o 


.ete is pointed out the method of meditation 
which is best suited for common persons who are 
engaged m worldly concerns, that i* to say for those 

meditate on the atfcnbuteless 


that are not qualified to i 
Brahman The bliss derived fro 


material objects is 


preliminary to and part and parcel of Brahmic bliss 
Mental operations are of three kinds, calm (safcvic) 
active (Rajas) and ignorant (Tamasic) Calm Satvio 
operations are renunciation, generosity, uprightness Ac r 
Active Rajasic operations are desire, attachment to 
objects, greediness, coveting anothers property Ac, 
The ignorant Tamasic operations are folly, fear Ac 
Brahmic consciousness is reflected in all the three kinds 
of operations When reflected in Sat vie operations 
bliss is additionally manifested As Rajasic and tamasic 
operations aie impure, the blissful aspect of Brahman 
is hidden and only the consciousness is reflected It is 
a matter of common experience that desire for objects 
always gives nso to misery Attachment to an object 
creates desire which gives rise to anger, if there is any 
obstacle to the fulfillment of desire Anger gives nse to 
enmity and enmity to quarrel which is simply misery 
When the desired object is obtained and enjoyed, there 
is some happiness which after all is only short lived as 



629 


one desire leads to another Whatever happiness is 
caused, it ib a reflection of Brahmio bhss When the 
mental operations are turned inwards the reflection of 
bhss comes unobstructed In objects like clay, stones 
&o, only existence is manifested In Rajasio and 
Tamasio operations of intellect, existence and conscious 
ness are manifested In the tranquil Satvic operations, 
existence, consciousness and bhss are all revealed 
Thus is described Brahman associated with phenomenal 
universe Maya is of the nature of non existence, want 
of consciousness and misery The objects of the 
universe should be thought of as manifesting either one, 
two or three of the Brahmic indications To meditate 
on Brahman m the indifferent state of the mind, when 
it is full of the impressions of Brahmic bliss and when 
the operations of the intellect are at a minimum, is the 
best of the methods of meditation In the self lumm 
ous, conscious/ associateless and SQCondless Brahmic 
nature, there is an absence of the triad of knower, 

knowledge and known That is spoken of as Brahmio 
bliss
