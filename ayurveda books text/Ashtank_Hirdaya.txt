Foreword 



Ragadirogan satatanusaktanasesakayaprasrtanasesan; 
Autsukyamoharatidanjaghana yo'purvavaidyaya namo'astu tasmai. 

It was really a pleasure to review and to write a few words as foreword on the press copy of the book 
'Astariga Hrdaya : Sutrasthana' authored by Dr. R. Vidyanath. The book comprises of the text and the 
translation with detailed comments and updated information on different aspects which are very useful 
for the present generation of readership today. The efforts to add the botanical names and photographs 
of many medicinal plants to provide useful lead to correlate the same with the classical Sanskrit names 
are commendable. The designed diagrams of some surgical instruments and certain treatment 
procedures are really interesting particularly in the context of the study of a Samhita Grantha. This 
effort obviously adopts the message of Vagbhata himself who stated at the very outset of Astariga 
Sarigraha, that this treatise is being created to make Ayurveda Sastra yuganurupa. 

The language of the write-up and the overall presentation of the book is easy to go through for a maiden 
reader. The entire approach appears critical and creative exercising adequate care to conserve the 
originality of the book and its contemporary readability. I hope this new addition to the contemporary 
Ayurvedic literature will benefit the students and teachers of Ayurveda in pursuing the subject in a 
right perspective. 

Astariga Hrdaya is an important classic text of great educational significance as it is prescribed as a text 
book for graduate students in view of its easy accessibility and because it is a better organized text than 
the Astariga Sarigraha. 

The galaxy of Foundation texts of Ayurveda comprise of two sets of authentic texts fondly called 1. 
Brhattrayi and 2. Laghutrayi. Brhattrayi texts are 1. Caraka Samhita, 2. Susruta Sarhhita and 3. The 
Sarhhitas of Vagbhata (Sarigraha and Hrdaya). Most often the Astariga Hrdaya is counted among the 
Brhattrayi, not so often the Astariga Sarigraha. However many scholars believe that Astariga Sarigraha 
is the prime text of Vagbhata. 

The Laghutrayi texts are 1. Madhava Nidana (900 AD), 2. Sarrigadhara Samhita (1300 AD) and 3. 
Bhavaprakasa ( 1 600 AD). The historians consider the Brhattrayi texts, especially Caraka and Susruta, 
as the pre-Christian texts while Laghutrayi are the medieval texts. 

In Indian historical traditions there have been several scholars holding the name of Vagbhata. The 
famous Ayurvedic texts Astariga Sarigraha and Astariga Hrdaya are also authored by the one or the 
other Vagbhata. Vagbhata represents the golden age of the Indian history, i.e. Gupta period and hence 
it gives a literary glimpse of the Ayurvedic tradition and cultural status of that period in India. There 
has been a controversy where the author of Astariga Sarigraha and Astariga Hrdaya is the same 
Vagbhata or they are two different persons. However, considering many facts, it is largely believed 
that they were two different persons and the two treatises were written in two different periods of 
history by two different authors. 



(vi) 



There are controversies about the period of Vagbhata. It seems the author of the Astariga Sarigraha, 
Vagbhata's time was somewhere between the period of Vatsyayana (500 AD) and Varahamihira (600 
AD). Vatsyayana was an expert of Kamasastra while Varahamihira dealt with another branch of 
knowledge viz. Jyotisa and Vagbhata was a physician, besides being an erudite poet. The Vagbhata's 
classics are largely the collection and codification of facts discovered through the works of Agnivesa - 
Caraka, and Susruta - Nagarjuna and their contemporaries, besides certain new ideas and facts to 
update the knowledge which seems to be the theme of Vagbhata as is evident by his own statement in 
the text: 

Yuganurupasandarbho vibhagena karisyate. (Vagbhata Su. 1:20) 

Sarvatantranyatab pray ah sarhhrtya'stangasangrahah; 
Asthanavistaraksepah punaruktadivarjitah. (Vagbhata Su. 1:18) 

It seems Astariga Hrdaya was compiled by another author later in order to make the subject more 
concise and easy to handle. The author of Astanga Sangraha is believed to have greater impact of 
Buddhism as is evident by author's own omissions to Buddha. The critical comparative study of the 
two texts in terms of the impact of earlier classics like Caraka and Susruta, it is believed that Astariga 
Sangraha has more Caraka's impact while Astariga Hrdaya carries an impact of Susruta. The style and 
approach of the two texts becomes obvious if one compares the depth and girth of the two texts. 
Astariga Sarigraha has 150 chapters and Astariga Hrdaya has 120 chapters displayed in different 
divisions as described in the following table which reflects the preferential inclusion and exclusion of 
the subject matter and the size of the texts. It will be interesting to undertake a critical comparative 
study of all the Samhitas in relation to the period of compilation and the reason of such differences.

The Sarigraha and the Hrdaya texts of Vagbhata written dominantly in prose and poetry respectively 
representing a glimpse of the Sastnya tendency of Vibhaga vs Sarhyoga, Vigraha vs Sarigraha and 



(vii) 

Vistara vs Samksepa. Astariga Sarigraha is the leading text of Sarigraha style which incorporates the 
subject matter from different Tantras and reproduces the same in a summarized form with greater 
clarity, while Astariga Hrdaya adopts different style. Further it is obvious that ancient classics like 
Caraka and Susruta deliberated more on the fundamental and philosophic aspects of the subject while 
the later texts diverted them from philosophy towards practical aspects. 

The present volume under publication by Dr. R. Vidyanath presently limits itself to the Sutra Sthana of 
Astariga Hrdaya which contains 30 chapters namely 1. Ayuskamiya, 2. Dinacarya, 3. Rtucarya, 4. 
Roganutpadaniya, 5. Drava-dravya Vijnaniya, 6. Annaswarupa Vijnaniya, 7. Annaraksa, 8. 
Matrasitiya, 9. Dravyadi Vijnaniya, 10. Rasabhediya, 11. Dosadi Vijnaniya, 12. Dosabhediya, 13. 
Dosopakramaniya, 14. Dwividhopakramanlya, 15. Sodhanadi-gana Sarigraha, 16. Sneha-vidhi, 17. 
Sweda-vidhi, 18. Vamana-virecana-vidhi, 19. Vasti-vidhi, 20. Nasya-vidhi, 21. Dhumapana-vidhi, 
22. Gandusadi-vidhi, 23. Ascotana-anjana-vidhi, 24. Tarpana-putapaka-vidhi, 25. Yantra-vidhi, 26. 
Sastra-vidhi, 27. Siravyadha-vidhi, 28. Salyaharana-vidhi, 29. Sastrakarma-vidhi, 30. Ksara- 
agnikarma-vidhi. 

Each of these 30 chapters have been presented in this volume with original Sanskrit text followed by 
descriptive interpretation and author's reader-friendly comments in a lucid style, not caring critically 
about the mere literary translation. He follows an illustrated style of presentation taking help of a 
number of photographs and diagrams for the purpose of comparative study in the present day 
perspective especially about medicinal plants, blunt and sharp surgical instruments and certain 
therapeutic procedures. However, the authenticity of these illustrations will have to be validated and 
verified in subsequent editions of this book after inputs from the readers. 

Summarily, this book is a student-friendly scholarly work of great value. This is an important addition 
to the contemporary literature in Ayurveda. I have known the author of this book Dr. Vidyanath for 
many years. He is an erudite scholar of Ayurveda and is an activist and an enthusiast in his field. I 
congratulate the author for this good work and wish this publication a grand success.

PREFACE 



During the ancient times, Acaryas of Ayurveda had written voluminous works on different 
specialties, which were not tangible to mediocre students. So, the time demanded in writing 
concise books, which cover the essentials of all the eight branches of Ayurveda. 

Vagbhata was the first person who composed a treatise entitled Astariga Sarigraha by bringing 
together the relevant medical knowledge contained in Caraka Sarhhita, Susruta Sarhhita, 
Harita Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Kasyapa Sarhhita etc. 

The author himself says "By churning the great ocean of medical science, a great store of 
nectar by name Astariga Sarigraha was obtained. From that store of nectar, a short treatise 
entitled Astariga Hrdaya was written for the benefit of mediocre students". 

Acarya Vagbhata was the son of Sirhhagupta and the grand son of Vagbhata belongs to the 
region of river Sindhu. His fore fathers were also great scholars of Ayurveda. He was the 
disciple of Avalokita, the chief monk of Mahayana Buddhism. Basing on the internal and 
external evidences the date of Vagbhata can be fixed between 4 th and 5 th century AD. 

Astanga Hrdaya is one of the most celebrated and most often studied treatises on Indian 
Medicine, after Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita. The work significantly begins with an 
aphoristic preface "What follows is what was said by great sages, Atreya and others." This 
work generally follows the general plan of Astariga Sarigraha and divided into six sections, 1 20 
chapters. The total number of verses is 7 1 20 in the extant edition. 

Sutra Sthana is the first section contains 30 chapters dealing with Basic principles of 
Ayurveda, preventive measures, diet and dietetics, classification of diseases and methods of 
treatments etc. Sarira Sthana is the second section contains 6 chapters dealing with 
embryology, anatomy, physiology, physical and psychological constitutions, auspicious and 
inauspicious dreams and omens, signs of bad prognosis etc. Nidana Sthana is the third section 
contains 16 chapters dealing with etiological factors, signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and 
prognosis of important diseases etc. Cikitsa Sthana is the fourth section contains 22 chapters 
dealing with the line of treatment of various diseases including pathyapathya. Kalpa-Siddhi 
Sthana is the fifth section contains 6 chapters dealing with formulations and methods 
pertaining to elimination therapy, management of complications, principles of pharmacy etc. 
Uttara Tantra is the sixth section contains 40 chapters dealing with the remaining seven 
branches of Ayurveda. 

This work has as many as 37 commentaries, the largest number for any early medical classics. 
It has been translated into many languages viz. Tibetan, Arabic, German etc. In the Tibetan 
canon, Tangyur (8 AD) is included a translation of this work along with Caraka Sarhhita and 



(ix) 



Susruta Samhita. It was also translated into Arabic about the same time under orders from 
Baghdad Caliphs. Another translation was available into German, which was taken up by 
Luise Hilgenburg & Wilibald Kirfel. The following is the list of commentaries available on 
Astanga Hrdaya either fully or partially. 

1 . Sarvanga Sundara by Aruna Datta ( 1 200 AD) was edited by Vijaya Ratna Sena Gupta, 
Calcutta in the year 1 888, and by Anna Moreswara Kunte, Bombay in the year 1 889. 

2. Ayurveda Rasayana by Hemadri (1271-1309) was edited by Hari Sastri Paradakara, 
Nirnayasagar Press, Bombay in the year 1939. 

3 . Padartha Candrika by Candranandana ( 1 0 th Cent. AD) 

4. Hrdaya Bodhika by Sridasa Pandita ( 14 th Cent. AD) 

5. Nidana Cintamani by Todaramalla (14 th Cent.- 1 5 th AD) 

6. Tattwa Bodha by Sivadasa Sena ( 1 5 th Cent. AD) 

7. Vagbhata Mandana by Bhatta Narahari ( 1 5 th Cent. AD) 

There is a compilation of drugs mentioned in this work, giving also synonyms, Astanga 
Nighantu of uncertain date. It contains a Telugu gloss. Another compilation of technical terms 
used in this work is Astanga Hrdaya Kosa by Valapad K.M. Vaidya ( 1 936). 

Early editions of this work : 

1 . Anna Moreswara Kunte ( 1 880) 

2. JivanandaVidyasagara ( 1 882) 

3 . Ganesa Sakharama Sarma ( 1 890) 

4. G.K. Garde (1891) 

5. Sankaradaji Sastri Pade ( 1 900) (Nirnaya Sagar Press, Bombay) 

Only Sutra Sthana of Astanga Hrdaya was prescribed by CCIM as a one of the subjects in the 
curriculum of BAMS course in the first profession. As on today sufficient number of Hindi as 
well as Regional language translations are available in the market. As a teacher of the 
concerned subject for the past decade, I have identified the necessity of proper study material 
in English language to cater the needs of freshly joined students of Ayurveda. Keeping this in 
view I have made an attempt to incorporate the translation of the text along with the related 
matter compiled from various resources in the form of notes. For a better comprehension, the 
book is supplemented with full of illustrations. In the annexure the following material is 
incorporated. 

1. Important Essay & Short Questions 

2. Important Slokas to be learnt by heart 

3 . Table of Weights and Measures 

4. Glimpse of Astanga Hrdaya 

5 . Alphabetical Index of the Herbs mentioned in the book 

6. Glossary of Sanskrit Terms

It may not be an exaggeration if I quote that this is the first illustrated book on Ayurvedic 
Sarhhitas. Though the present book is primarily written for undergraduate students of 
Ayurveda, it is hoped that Teachers, P.G. Scholars and General Practitioners would also find it 
useful as a reference book. Keeping the latest CCIM syllabus 2012 in view, Maulika Siddhanta 
part has also been incorporated at the end. 

At this juncture I am expressing the pure, warm, sweet and bright flame of gratefulness to my 
mother Mrs. Rajyalakshmi and to my father Late Dr. R. Satyanarayanacharyulu. I record my 
thanks to my life partner Mrs. Padma Vani and my beloved son Satya Teja for their unbounded 
affection and encouragement. Without whose infinite inspiration and co-operation, I could not 
have completed this work so smoothly within the stipulated time. 

I am extremely grateful to my beloved Guide, revered Preceptor, Versatile Scholar, Dr. K. 
Nishteswar, Professor & HOD Dravyaguna, IPGT & RA Gujarat Ayurveda University, 
Jamnagar for his continuous support and encouragement in all my activities. 

On this happiest occasion I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Prof. R.H. Singh, Ex. 
Dean, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi; Vice-chancellor, Rajasthan Ayurveda University, 
Jodhpur, a Versatile Scholar and an experienced teacher of Kayacikitsa for his acceptance to 
pen the foreword. 

I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my teachers, students and friends Dr. K.V. 
Ramana Raj, Dr. C.N. Murthy, Dr. Ch. Ramakrishna, Dr. D.A.P. Reddy, Dr. S. Venkat, Dr. 
Sarvesh, Dr. B. Ramarao, Dr. P. Manohar, Dr. P. Gayatri Devi, Dr. N. Srilakshmi, Dr. D. Vijay 
Ganeswara Reddy & Dr. K.J. Lavanya Lakshmi who helped me directly or indirectly for taking 
up this project.

YUSKAMlYA AdHYAYA 



est for Long Life] 




Preamble: 



Though there are a number of treatises available in the Ayurvedic literature, the popular texts 
are known as Caraka Samhita, Susruta Sarhhita and Astanga Hrdaya/Astariga Sangraha and 
these texts are much more familiar in the name of BrhattrayL i.e. greater trio. Madhavanidana, 
Sanigadhara Sarhhita and Bhavaprakasa became popular as Laghutrayii.t. lesser trio. 

The texts mentioned in greater trio i.e. Caraka Sarhhita and Susruta Sarhhita are called as Akara 
granthas. That means they are self-authentic where as Astanga Hrdaya can be called as 
Prakaranagrantha'x. e., which has been written by quoting the references from other texts. 

Out of all eight branches of Ayurveda, Maharsi Caraka has been given top priority to 
Kayacikitsai.e. general medicine, where as Maharsi Susruta discussed the surgical aspects in 
detail in his text Susruta Sarhhita. Keeping this in view Acarya Vagbhata has given equal 
importance to all the eight branches and written this present text entitled Astanga Hrdaya. 

Though various authors have written many a number of commentaries at different periods on 
Astanga Hrdaya Sarhhita, Arunadutta's 'Sarvarigasundan' and Hemadri's 'Ayurveda 
Rasayana' are the popular and available commentaries as on today. 

The text Astanga Hrdaya consists 6 divisions and 1 20 chapters as under: 

1 . Sutra Sthana : 30 Chapters 

2. Sarira Sthana : 6 Chapters 

3. Nidana Sthana : 16 Chapters 

4. Cikitsa Sthana : 22 Chapters 

5. Kalpa Sthana : 6 Chapters 

6. UttaraTantra : 40 Chapters 



120 Chapters 



In the literature of Ayurveda, four persons were seen by name Vagbhata as under: 



1 . Vrddha Vagbhata : Author of Astanga Sangraha. 

2. Madhya Vagbhata : Known through the commentary 



'Ratnaprabha' of Niscal akara. 



3 . Laghu Vagbhata : Author of Astanga Hrdaya. 

4. Rasa Vagbhata : Author of Rasaratna Samuccay a.

Vagbhata' s Geneological Tree 



(Vamsa V rksa) 




Vrddha Vagbhata 




Laghu Vagbhata 



By seeing the geneological tree of Vagbhata, it can be observed that the father of Vrddha 
Vagbhata is Simha Gupta and the son of Vrddha Vagbhata is also Sirhha Gupta which shows 
the Indian tradition of naming the forefathers name to the grandsons. 

Mangalacarana:

In Indian tradition there is a strong belief that for successful completion of any work taken up 
by them should be preceded by offering prayers to their beloved deity. Similarly Vagbhata also 
after praying his favorite God only, started writing the text entitled, Astanga Hrdaya. 

Acarya Vagbhata believed that God is the unique physician who is potential in eliminating all 
sorts of psychosomatic disorders such as passion, greed, lust, jealousy, anxiety, delusion, 
dissatisfaction, fever, diarrhoea etc. from this universe and bows his head to that supreme 
power and prayed that the ongoing work should not get any obstacles. 



Due to the short span of life in the present era, it is not possible for the human beings to study 
the various texts of Ayurvedic literature in detail. So, Vagbhata thought that the acuteness of 
necessity of the summarized text book which caters the medical needs of the humanity. That 
may be the reason to compile all the eight branches of Ayurveda from the Ayurvedic texts like 
Caraka Samhita, Susruta Samhita etc. and arranged the subject matter in a systematic way and 
presented the comprised, full-fledged Ayurvedic text named Astanga Hrdaya to the universe. 

All the available texts of Ayurveda have been taken into consideration by Acarya Vagbhata 
and compiled the essence of eight branches of Ayurveda and presented in the form of Astanga 
Hrdaya, which is neither too abridged nor too elaborated. 

Atha + atah means afterwards-after praying the God, Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 
named Ayuskamiyam (Quest for Long Life), thus said Atreya and other great sages. 




Reasons for Writing the Text : Astanga Hrdaya 



Ayuskamiya Adhyaya : 1 3 

Ayuskamiya means Ayuh kamebhyah hitah. This chapter is intended to those persons, who 
desire to have a long life. 

Both the words 'aum ' and 'atha ' did come out from the throat of the creator of universe, Lord 
Brahma initially. So, there is a strong belief that these two words are auspicious. That may be 
the reason to start the text, Astariga Hrdaya by Vagbhata with the word 'atha '. 

Definition ofayu: 

^l^^^lrH^i4)^il *nft 41fadH, I P^m^Rra M^4<l^?^cl II (C.S.Su. 1:41) 

Life is nothing but the combination of the body, sense organs, mind and soul. As long as these 
four are combined together life exists. 

Dharijivitam, nityagam and anubandham are the synonyms of life. 

Dhari: '^K^fa ^(kftfri snft' — the one that prevents the body from decay. 
Jlvitam: Mlcwfa *Fm^?fct ^d^'— which keeps alive. 

Nityagam: 'far*T J i^s>fci (*i(k*q Sifticbc^fci) f^FT:'— which serves as permanent substratum of 
this body. 

Anubandham: '3^^ (¥l(klf&l WTOI ^F^^R) 3T^q^T:' — which transmigrates from one 
body to another. 

Definition of Ayurveda: 

'3ng^T^frT$r4l^: l' (Sabdakalpadruma) 
Ayuranena vetti iti Ayurvedah- 6 ayu 'means life, 'vetti 'means science or knowledge. 
The science of life or knowledge of life is known as Ayurveda. 

Purpose of Ayurveda 

According to Indian Philosophers' view human beings are superior to any other living beings and 
there are certain aims and objectives for human beings, viz. dharma, artha, kama and moksa. 

Dharma: Dharrna is nothing but to determine the paths of life correctly and what ought to do 
and what should not be done and also renunciate the deeds which are harmful to others. 

Artha: Artha means money. Money is definitely essential for human life, but money is not the 
only essential thing. Earn money, but not at the cost of others. Select the right path, to earn 
money and one should not eager to earn. 

Kama: Kama means desire. One should renunciate the unlawful desires and fulfil the 
psychosomatic desires by selecting the right path only . 

Mok sa: The ultimate aim of the human beings is to attain moksa. He, who follows the 
instructions of the Indian philosophers, will definitely attain liberation.

Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 



To achieve these four aims and objectives of human life, healthy and long life is essential. 
Ayurveda teaches us how to lead a healthy, happy and long life. Hence the persons who desire 
to achieve the goals of human life should have faith in the teachings of Ayurveda. 

Ayurveda vatarana (Origin of Ayurveda): 




The Hindus believe the Science of Medicine to be of divine origin. According to this tradition 
Brahma the creator of the universe having known the immortal and eternal science of 
Ayurveda in full, taught it to Daksa Prajapati and Daksa taught to Aswins, the vedic Gods of 
medicine who inturn taught to Indra. 

All schools of Ayurveda agree with the divine geneology upto Indra, but give different 
versions regarding the transmission of the science among the mortals. 

When diseases began troubling the human beings and causing obstacles for the acquisition of 
purusarthas (i.e. dharma, artha, kama and moksa) sages like Dhanvantari, Bharadwaja, Nimi, 
Kasyapa and others went to Indra and prayed for the mankind to get relief from different 
psychosomatic disorders. Then Indra pleased and taught Astanga (eight branches) Ayurveda 
to the sages. 

Astanga Ayurveda (Eight Branches of Ayurveda): 
cbN^Mil^^f^lc^l^M<I^MI<ll5 II 

1 . Kaya-cikitsa (General Medicine) 

2. Bala-cikitsa/Kaumarabhrtya (Pediatrics) 

3 . Graha-cikitsa/Bhuta-vidya (Demonology ) 

4. Urdhvanga/Salakya-cikitsa(E. N. T. & Ophthalmology) 

5. Salya-cikitsa (Surgery) 

6. Darhstra-cikitsa/Agada tantra (Toxicology) 

7. Jara/Rasayana (Geriatrics) 

8. VrsafVajikarana (Aphrodisiacs) 

The management of diseases depends upon these eight branches i.e. Astanga Ayurveda. 

The sages having learnt the science and exchanged views among them and taught to their 
disciples like Agnivesa, Bhela, Jatukarna etc. They inturn wrote treatises and became popular 
in their names like Agnivesa Sarhhita, Bhela Sarhhita etc. 

In this way Ayurveda transmitted from the creator of the universe to the mortals.

Description of dosas: 



cTPJ: fori ch^£frT?|ifi fWlfld: 116 II 




A v u ska mi ya Adhyaya : 1

Briefly saying, vata, pitta and kapha are the three dosas (functional units or biological forces) 
\\ hich are existing in the body. These three dosas keeps the body in the healthy condition when 
they are in the equilibrium state, and causes diseases in the vitiated state. 

Notes : 

These three dosas have been divided into 3 types as: 

1. Vrddhi (increased state) 

2. Ksaya (decreased state) 

3. Samya (balanced or equilibrium state) 

Both vrddhi and ksaya have been further classified as mild, moderate and severe: 

1. Vrddhi : Alpa (mild) A.Ksina : ,4/pa(mild) 

l.Vrddhitara : Madhya (moderate) 5.Ksinatara : Ma dhya (moderate) 
3. Vrddhitama : Utkrsta (severe) 6.Kswatama : Utkrsta (severe) 

Briefly saying there are three dosas only. That means on an elaboration, more than three must 
be there. 

Basing on the site and functions of these dosas, they have been further classified as: 

Five types of vata : Prana, udana, vyana, samana and apana. 

Five types of pitta : Pacaka, ranjaka, sadhaka, alocaka bhrajaka. 

Five types of kapha : Kledaka, avalambaka, bodhaka, tarpaka and slesaka. 

This classification has been made only for the practical convenience. Some acaryas 
categorised the raktaas the 4th dosa basing on the following reasons: 

1. Sthana (site/place) : Yakrt, pliha (\iver& spleen). 

2. Laksana (qualities) : Padmalaktuka sannibharh indragopa-pratikasam. (Color ^of 

blood resembles lotus flower, lac and the insect indragopa). 

3. Kriya (function) : Supporting life and nourishing the body. 

4. Vikara (diseases) : Visarpa, pliha. 

5. Cikitsa (treatment) : Sira-vedhana (venesection). 

By the above reasons blood may be grouped under dosas. But it is not correct because as per the 
definition of dosa — 'rakta 9 is not vitiating any other dhatus, but itself is being vitiated by the 
three dosas. So, rakta cannot be called as dosa. Hence the dosas existing in the body are three 
only. 

Site of vata, pitta and kapha: 

Though the three dosas- vata, pitta and kapha spreads all over the body, they are found 
predominantly in the following places: 



8 



A stariga H rda yam : Sutra-st hana 



Vata : Below the naval region. 

Pitta : In between the heart &umblicus. 

Kapha : Above the heart region. 

Relationship between the dosas and the age, day, night and diet: 

Vata, pitta and kapha are predominantly present in the last, middle and 
first stages of age, day, night and diet respectively. 

That means — 




Vata is predominantly present in the 

1. Last stage of the age 

2. Last stage of the day 

3. Last stage of the night 

4. Last stage of the diet 

Pitta is predominantly present in the: 

1. Middle stage of the age 

2. Middle stage of the day 

3. Middle stage of the night 

4. Middle stage of the diet 



Old age 
Evening hours 
Ending hours of the night 
End of digestion. 

Middle age 

Midday 

Midnight 

During the process of digestion.

Similary kapha is predominant in the 
1 . First stage of the age 



Childhood 
Morning hours 
Starting of night hours 
Beginning of the digestion. 

Relationship between agni (power of digestion) & dosas:

2. First stage of the day 

3 . First stage of the night 

4. First stage of the diet 



Basing on the dominancy of tridosas power of digestion has been classified as under: 
Due to the predominance of— 

Unsteady or erratic digestive activity. 
Increased digestive activity. 
Decresed digestive activity. 
Normal digestive activity. 

Influence of dosas on kostha (Bowels): 



1 . Vata causes visamagni 

2. Pitta causes tiksnagni 

3. Kapha causes mandagni 

4. Tridosas causes samagni 



Bowels also having the direct relationship with the dominancy of dosas. 
Due to the: 



L Vata dominancy 

2. Pitta dominancy 

3. Kapha dominancy 



Krura kostha (hard bowels) 
Mrudu kostha (soft bowels) 
Madhyama kostha (moderate bowels). 

In the equilibrium state also madhyama kostha (moderate bowels) will be seen. 

Deha prakrti (Body constitution): 

¥jchl<Jc^vjf~M| cfl fat)u>c( faMfofl : ||9 II 

The constitution of the body will be formed at the time of the union of 
spermatozoa and the ovum, due to the dominancy of the dosa having at 
that time, just as the poisonous worms developed from the poisonous 
material. The constitution of the body is of 7 types according to the 
combination of dosas. 



Due to the dominancy of single dosa: 

1 . Vata prakrti 

2. Pitta prakrti 

3. Kapha prakrti 




Hina (poor) 
Madhyama (moderate) 
Uttama (good).

The vitiation of any of the two dosas i.e. either vrddhi or £saya can be called as samsarga and 
the vitiation of all the 3 dosas cm be termed as sannipata. 

Notes: 

Such combinations are 6 and 10 depending upon the decrease and increase of the dosas as 
under. 

Six types of samsargaja: 
1 . Increased one dosa and decreased the other one/balanced state. 



Ayuskamiya Adhyaya : 1 11

Description of dhatus and malas: 

After that sapta dhatus (seven tissues) and trimalas (three waste products) and their functions 
have been discussed as under. 

Seven tissues of the body: 

1 . Rasa dhatu (plasma) 

2. Rakta dhatu (blood) 

3. Maihsa dhatu (muscle tissue) 

4. Medo dhatu (fatty tissue) 

5. Asthi dhatu (bony tissue) 

6. Majja dhatu (bone marrow) 

7. Sukra dhatu (semen, reproductive elements).

Dhatus are so named because they support the body all through the life and they gets vitiated by 
the three dosas and are called as dusyas. 

Malas also gets vitiated by the three dosas, so that they are also included under the category of 
dusyas. 

Notes: 

Functions of the seven tissues: 



1 . Rasa dhatu 

2. Rakta dhatu 

3. Mams a dhatu 

4. Medo dhatu 

5. Asthi dhatu 

6. Majja dhatu 

7. Sukra dhatu 



Prinana (satisfaction to the mind and nourishing) 
• Jivana (supporting life) 
Lepa (covering the body) 
Sneha (lubrication/oleation) 
Dharana (supporting the body) 
Purana (filling the bone cavities) 
Garbhotpadana (getting pregnancy). 

These tissues are not only supporting the body but also serves as food to the succeeding tissues. 

During the process of evolution of tissues, the ingested food is converted into rasa dhatu after 
the completion of the process of digestion. 



Ayuskamiya Adhyaya : 1 13 
Then rasa dhatu divides into 3 parts as under: 

• First part helps for the construction of the own tissue. 

• Second part will be useful for the nourishment of the succeeding tissue i. e. blood. 

• The third part becomes the waste product. 

Similarly all the tissues are divided into 3 parts and the second part will be useful for the 
nourishment of the succeeding tissues. 

In this way the preceding tissues produces food for the succeeding ones. 
Vrddhi and ksaya: 

Due to the ingestion of the food having similar qualities vrddhi (increase) will be taken place in 
the body and ksaya (decrease) will be seen while taking the opposite qualities of food 
substances. 

Notes: 

Both vrddhi (increase) and ksaya (decrease) are of 3 kinds according to dravya (substance), 
fiina (qualities) and karma (function). 

L Dravya samanya : Intake of mutton increases the muscle tissue due to 
the similar substances. 

2. Guna samanya : Sweet and heavy substances increases kapha dosa due to 

the similar qualities. 

3. Karma samanya : Exercise increases vata dosa by similar action. 

4. Dravya visesa : Intake of food prepared by wheat decreases muscle tissue. 

5. Guna visesa : Ksara (alkalines) decreases kapha dosa. 

6. Karma visesa : Excessive exercises leads kapha-ksaya. 

Rasa: 

THT: Wl^mcHc|U|friTt)lMU|cbMmchl: 111 411 

Rasa is nothing but the taste which is being perceived by the tongue. 

In Ayurveda 6 tastes have been described as under: 

1 . Madhura rasa (sweet) 4. Tiktarasa (bitter) 

I Amla rasa (sour) 5. Usana/Katu rasa (pungent) 

; . La vana rasa (salt) 6. Kasaya rasa (astringent). 

These 6 tastes are associated with the substances and having more strength in their preceding 
order. 



14 Astanga Hrdayam : SO t ra-st liana 

Influence of rasas over dosas: 

The first mentioned three tastes of the above i.e. madhura, amla, lavana rasas mitigates vata 
and increases kapha dosa. While the rest of the three tastes tikta rasa, usana rasa, kasaya rasa 
mitigates kapha and increases vata dosa, Kasaya, tikta, madhura rasas mitigates pitta and katu, 
amla, lavana rasas increases pitta dosa.

The above-mentioned tastes are associated with the substances. Those substances are of 3 
kinds viz., 

1 . Samana dra vyas : Alleviates dosas 

2. Kopana dra vyas : Vitiates dhatus 

3. Swastha hita : Which maintains the normalcy. 

Eg. Drugs having sweet in taste, unctuous & heaviness in qualities reduces the vitiated vata due 
to the opposite qualities. 

Ghrta reduces pitta due to madhura rasa & other gunas. 

Similary, honey reduces kaphadue to the astringent taste and dryness. 

The combination of milk and fish increases the dosasdue to the incompability. 

The food items, which are taking regularly i.e. barley, wheat, sali rice, milk etc., are suitable for 
the maintenance of the positive health.

Virya: 

dWJ|^lldJJurir^MfTl5i cfl4f|^n^rT^I 

\ Irya means potency which exists in a substance. Basing on the dominancy of the qualities of a 
substance 2 types of virya has been described as — 1 . usna virya (hot in potency), 2. sita virya 
. old in potency). 

Vipaka: 

f^TT fclMlchl s^HJ Wiamchdcblrqcb: 111 7 II 

\fter the completion of the process of digestion, all the substances (either ausadha dravyasox 
ahara dravyas) will be converted into one of the 3 tastes viz., sweet, sour or pungent. The 
pn cess of transformation is called as vipaka. 

Madhura, lavanamsa dravyas will be converted into madhura vipaka. 
Am la rasa dravyas will be converted into amla vipaka. 

Where as katu, tikta, kasaya rasa dravyas will be converted into katu vipaka, after the 
completion of the digestion. 

Guna: 

In total 4 1 gunas (qualities) have been enumerated in Ayurveda as under: 
Artha{5) : Objects of sense organs — 

( indriyartha) [sabda (sound), sparsa (touch), rupa (vision), rasa (taste) and gandha 

(smell)] 

Gurvadi* (20) : Dravya guna or dwandwa guna 

A(rnagunas(6) : Buddhi (intellect), sukha (happiness), duhkha (misery), iccha (desire),

^^^RH^UVH^mi^^RAy<l: I^JTT.^^ftVKI RiVlfrl: 44faM4i||: 111 811 

he above 20 gurvadi gunas are also called as dravya gunas. The respective opposites of 
these gunas are as follows: 

1. Guru (heaviness) x Laghu (lightness) 

2. Man da (dullness) x Tiksna (sharpness) 

3. Hima/Sita (cold) x Usna{hoi)

Along with the above 20 qualities some drugs contain vyavayi and vikasigunas also. 

Vyavayi: Which spreads all over the body initially and undergoes digestion later. 

VikasI: Which harms the tissues of the body and causes loosening of the joints. 

Some acaryas quoted that vyavayi and vikasi dravya are those, which consists sara (mobile) 
and tiksna (sharpness) gunas ; respectively. 

Hetu (Causative factors for diseases): 

The present verse represents an exposition of causative factors responsible for the production 
of all most all diseases pertaining to the body and mind. 

f 

The 3-fold causes are: 

• Insufficient utilisiation (hmayoga), 

• Wrong utilisation (mithyayoga) and 

• Excessive utilisation {atiyoga) 

of time (kala), objects of the sense organs (indriyarthas) and the activities of the body, mind 
and speech (karma). 

Where as the proper utilisation (samyak yoga) of the above factors results in healthy state. 
Notes: 

Triskandhas: 

Ayurveda is based on triskandhas viz., 

• Hetu skandha (causative factors/aetiology) 

• Lihga skandha (signs and symptoms/symptomatology) 

• Aushadha skandha (drugs/treatment/knowledge of therapeutics). 

Hetu skandha: 

1. Kala (time) : Parinama 

2. Artha : Asatmyendriyartha samyoga 

3. Karma : Prajnaparadha. 



Ayuskamiya Adhyaya : 1 17 



Hetu skandha 


Linga skandha 


Ausadha skandha 


Asatmendriyartha sarhvoga: 
Hinayoga, mithyayoga, 
atiyoga. 

Prajnaparadha: 
Hinayoga, mithyayoga, 
atiyoga. 

Parinama: 

Jara (ageing), ksut (hunger), 
pipasa (thirst). 


Purvarupa, rupa, 
upasaya, anupasaya, 
samprapti. 


Dosa samana, 
kopana, swasta-hita. 



Due to the above causative factors dosas gets vitiated and various signs and symptoms will be 
formed as shown in linga skandha. By selecting the appropriate drugs from ausadha skandha, 
which brings the vitiated dosas to the normalcy, is one of the aims and objectives of Ayurveda. 

Kala(Time): 

Hinayoga : Heat in summer, cold in winter is decreased than the normal condition. 
Mithyayoga : Cold in summer, and heat in winter. 

Atiyoga : More heat in summer and more cold in winter than tl\e normal climatic 
condition. 

Artha/Indriyartha (Objects of sense organs): 

Hinayoga : Insufficient utilisation of sense organs. 

Sabda — hearing very low sound/not hearing any sound. 
Sparsa — not touching anything. 
Rupa — seeing objects in dimlight. 
Rasa — not tasting. 
Gandha — not smelling. 

Mithyayoga : Seeing unnatural objects.

i 



18 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

Karma (Activities of body, mind and speech) : 

Hlnayoga : Not doing any activity or doing very little of it physically, mentally or vocally. 

Mithyayoga : Doing unusual activities like suppression of natural urges, falling from great 
height etc. 

Atiyoga : Indulging in activities more than usual like excessive exercises, coitus, riding, 
talking, thinking etc. 

Disease-health: 

Disease is nothing but the vitiation of the dosas and their equilibrium state can be termed as 
health. 

Class ill cat ion of disease according to origin: 
faviiHi^fa'iiiriH <l'll feUTTiJrTT: 1120 II 

According to the origin, diseases can be classified into 2 groups as under: 

1. Nijarogas (endogenous) 

2. Agantujarogas (exogenous). 

Nijarogas : In nija rogas, due to the irregular diet, dietetics and activities, dosas gets vitiated at 
first and then signs and symptoms of the disease condition will be seen. 

Agantujaroga : Where as in agantuja rogas due to abhighata (accident) signs and symptoms of 
the disease will be seen first and then followed the vitiation of the dosas. 

Receptacles of diseases: 

Both the body and the mind are the receptacles of the diseases. 
^WM^lT^^^^MI^I^dl 112 1 ll 

Sattva* rajas and tamas are the qualities of manas (mind) and can be called as mahagunas. Out 
of the trigunas, satt'va guna being good, is conductive to health, but rajas and tamas are 
considered as the two dosasof the mind causes the psychological disorders. 

Rogi-roga pariksa: 

Patient is to be examined by the following methods: 

1 . Darsana pariksa (inspection), 

2. Sparsanapaiiksa (palpitation), 

3. Prasna pariksa {miznog&iion). 



Ayuskamiya Adhyaya : 1 



19 



ft* 




: 112 2 II 



And the diseases can be diagnosed with the help of Nidana pancaka. 

1 . Nidana (causative factors) 

2. Prag/Purvarupa (prodromal symptoms) 

3. Laksana/Rupa (signs and symptoms) 

4. Upasaya/Anupasaya (therapeutic test) 

5. Samprapti (pathogenesis) 

Types of desa and their relationship with dosas: 

*jft^M*l$H ^VIMIgRg QtUT I cJM^RjBM'jM <J cbiblc<stUIHJI2 3 II 



Here desa denotes two meanings viz. 

1. Bh umi (region) 

2. Deha (human body) 

Jangala desa, anupa and sadharana are of 3 types of regions. 

In jangala desa vata dosa is predominantly present and in anupa desa kapha dosa is 
predominant. Whereas in sadharana desa normalcy of dosas will be seen. 

Types of kala: 

^|UMf^oi|I^^4Am^chlHl ^«M±ft'l$<1JI24ll 




Kala (time) is divided into two kinds: 

1 . Ksanadikala ( moment, second, minute, hour, etc.) 

2 . Vyadhya vastha kala ( 6 stages of the disease i.e. satkriya kalas). 

Types of therapies: 

Briefly saying the therapies are of 2 types as: 

1 . Sodhana (elimination therapy) 

2. Samama (palliative measures) 

Sodhana: Bringing normalcy of dosas by eliminating the vitiated dosas from the body with the 
help of the five therapeutic procedures (Pancakarmas) can be called as sodhana therapy. 

Samana: To bring normalcy without eliminating the vitiated dosas and simply by adopting the 
palliative measures can be termed as samana therapy. 

Out of these two types of treatments sodhana therapy is superior to samana therapy. Because 
dosas do at times gets aggravated by adopting palliative measures but there is no chance of 
relapsation by treating the vitiated dosas with sodhana therapy.

General line of treatment for psychosomatic disorders: 

This verse represents an exposition of the general line of treatment for sariraka and manasika 
dosas. 

The best line of treatment for vata, pitta and kapha is vasti (medicated enemata), vireka 
(purgation therapy) and vamana (emesis) and the best drugs of choice is taila (sesame oil), 
ghrta (ghee) and madhu (honey) respectively.

Dhi (discrimination), dhairya (courage) and atmadi vijnana (spiritual teachings) are the best 
medicines for psychological disorders (or) manasika dosas. 

Pada catustaya (Four limbs of treatment): 

The four limbs of treatment are: 

1 . Bhisak (the physician) 3. Upasthata (the attendant) 

2. Dravya (the drug) 4. Rogi (the patient) 

Each one has four qualities and these 4 limbs are responsible for the cure of diseases. 
Qualities of an ideal physician: 

* Possessing the professional efficiency. 

* Having sound knowledge in theory. 

* Vast experience in the practical aspects, and 

* Having sanctity or purity in the acts of mind, body and speech are the four 
qualities of the physician. 

Qualities of an ideal drug: 

Bahukalpam: Drug should be useful to formulate various pharmaceutical 
preparations like swarasa (fresh juice of leaves), kalka (paste), curna (powd- 
er), kwatha (decoction) etc. according to the choice of the patient and the 
need of the hour. 




* 




A yuskami ya Adhyaya : 1 



21 




Bahugu nam: Drug also should contain highest number of qualities (gurvadigunas). So that the 
same drug can be utilised in a number of disease conditions by altering anupana. 

ipannam: Drugs should be potent and free from infection and moisture. 

: j yam: And also suitable to the patient and diseases according to the region and season. 

Qualities of an ideal attendant: 

Anurakta (Affection): Attendant should have utmost affection and 
s ervice motto towards the patient. 

Suei (Purity): Purity or sanctity in all aspects means physical as well as 
psychological. Attendant should have the devotion and dedication 
rds the profession and should not consider any evil thoughts. 

Dak s ata (Skill): Attendant must be perfectly trained and should have 
skill and the knowledge of nursing. 

Buddhiman: And also must have intelligence. 
Qualities of an ideal patient: 

3Jlcfcj) ^nf^N'c^ ?NMcb: Urc<c|Hfa 112 9 II 

Ad hya (Wealthy): Patient must be wealthy. Then only he is 
able to purchase the equipment and drugs required for the 
treatment. 

Bhis agvasya (Obedient to the physician): Patient must be 
obedient and should follow the instructions of the physician. 

Jnapaka (Memory): Patient should have memory to narrate the 
Nequence of historical events pertaining to his ailments, which 
i s essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. 

Sattvawan (Strong will): Sattva means manas or mind. Sattvawan means having strong will 
power. Patients who are having strong will power can tolerate miserable situations also. 

Though the remaining limbs are equipped with all qualities, it is useless, if the physician is 
inefficient. But if the physician is efficient, he can manage the treatment even though the other 
limbs are not equipped with their full qualities. 

Hence the physician occupies the most important position among the four limbs of treatment 
by virtue of his knowledge, administrative position and by prescribing capacity.

In this way Astanga Hrdaya consists 120 chapters and is divided into six sections viz. Sutra 
Sthana, Sarira Sthana, Nidana Sthana, Cikitsa Sthana, Kalpa-siddhi Sthana and Uttara Tantra. 

Thus ends the first chapter entitled Ayuskamiya Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana in 
Astanga Hrdaya Sarhhita, which was composed by Acarya Vagbhata son of 
Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta. 

In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata explained constituents of the body dosas, dhatu, tnalas; types 
of dosas — saririka, manasika, their places, general qualities, main functions of the dhatus and

DlNACARYA AdHYAYA 
[ Daily Regimen ] 




After 'Ayuskamiya Adhyaya\ Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter named 'Dinacarya 
(Daily Regimen) thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

Maintain the positive health in the healthy individuals and treating the diseased persons are the 
two main aims of Ayurveda. Keeping this in view Acarya Vagbhata emphasized the 
importance of preventive aspect and allocated separate chapters like Dinacarya, Rtucaryaetc. 

Healthy person should have the equilibrium state of the three humors of the body, seven 
tissues, three waste products and the power of digestion along with pleasant mind, soul and 
sense organs. 

Pratahkalotthana (Wakeup time): 

In order to protect his life, healthy person should get up from the bed in 
brahma muhurta. 




Notes : 

Basing on the above statement it is inferred that unhealthy or diseased 
person need not wakeup early in the morning and has to follow the Brahma muhurta 
instructions of the physician concerned. Brahma muhurta is the time, which is second half of 
the last yama (3 hours) of the night or early hours of the dawn i.e. approximately at about 4.24 
A.M. 

Arunadatta in his 'Sarvarigasundari' commentary on Astaiiga Hrdaya it is clearly stated as— 

That means brahma muhurta is the 14th muhurta kala of the night. One muhurta is equivalent to 
48 minutes. 

Whole night consists 15 muhurtas- 15x48 = 720 minutes. 

Brahma muhurta is the time, which is after the completion of 1 3 muhurtas in the night time i.e. 
1 3 x 48 = 624 minutes. 

720-624 = 96 minutes. 



Dinacarya Adhyaya : 2 



27 



Hence one has to getup from the bed early in the morning 96 minutes before sunrise i.e. at about 
4.24 a.m. 

It is the suitable time to study and obtain knowledge. It is also the time when all the three dosas 
are in the equilibrium state. 

Sauca vidhi (Cleansing): 



After considering the condition of the body (such as food taken in the previous night has been 
fully digested or not etc.), one has to attend for the natural urges and clean the parts well. 

Notes: 

* Healthy persons should eliminate the natural urges like faeces and urine etc. facing north in 
the morning hours and south in the night. 

* During defecation one should be silent, sit and cover the head with a cloth. 

* Avoid forceful expulsion. 

* Avoid defecating at dirty places, center of the road, heaps of ash, cowshed, burial ground, 
sacred places, in front of women and respectable persons, facing sun and moon etc. 

* But at times of fear and sick persons may void the excrements as they wish. 

* At the time of urge, one should not attend any other work. 

* Suppressing the natural urges leads vitiation of vata, which in turn causes many a number 
of diseases.

After 'Dinacarya Adhyaya 9 Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Rtucarya 9 (Seasonal 
Regimen), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

Preamble: 

In Astanga Sangraha Sutrasthana 4th chapter detailed description about kala has been 
delineated asunder: 

Kala (Time): 

r^MRuH-d) *1^di v3l^H<u|^^^4<1^^-<s|d^NrH^<j ^ cbRUH ^frlM^I^) I 

* Kala is divinity and it has neither a beginning nor an end. Time follows the accumulated 
effect of actions of the past. 

Basing on the time only, the movement of the sun, the moon and other planets and also the 
transformation of five basic elements take place. 

his also the causative factor for the birth and the death of all the creatures. 

* Similarly, the increase and decrease of the seasons, tastes and potency of the substances, 
strength of the dosas and the body depends upon the time only. 

Kala-bheda (Division of time): 

K ila i s divided into the following 1 2 divisions: 

L Matra 4. Nadika 7. Ahoratra 10. Rtu 

2. Kastha 5. Muhurta 8. Paksa 11. Ay ana

The months starting with magha, in combination of two, two succeeding months constitute the 
6 seasons as sisira, vasanta, grisma, varsa, sarad and hemanta respectively. 

Adana kala — the three of them commencing with sisira rtu (i. e. sisira, vasanta and grisma) are 
characterised by the northern movement of the sun and is also called uttarayana or adana kiiln. 
because sun absorbs strength from living beings daily.

* Since the northward movement of the sun naturally increases the heat of the places it 
approaches, the cooling properties are weakened. 

* During this period the sun with his severe hot rays and the winds with their sharp velocity 
and dryness absorb the moisture from the earth. 

* Due to the progressive dryness in the atmosphere during the seasons of sisira, vasanta and 
grisma, which enhances tikta, kasaya and katu rasas respectively and results in the human 
beings become weak. Therefore adana (agneya) is sweltering by nature. 

Visarga kala: 



Rtucarya Adhyaya : 3 45 

The remaining three seasons commencing from varsa rtu (i.e. varsa, sarad and hemanta) are 
: aracterized by the southern movement of the sun (daksinayana) and is also called visarga 
kala. 

-H&<A fa^r^HJ^^^K*! fhlflf^GWcn^il^ 4|ch 115 II 

* All the living beings gains strength during this period. 

* Visarga is saumya. Moon is dominating in this period and the power of the sun is becoming 
weak. 

* Due to clouds, cold breeze and rain, the power of the sun reduces and moon occupies the 
driving seat. 

* Due to the power of moon with its cold rays unctuousness increases gradually in the nature 
during the seasons of varsa, sarad 'and hemanta, which enhances amla, law ana and madhura 
rasas respectively and results in the human beings become strong and potent. 



Differences between adana kala and visarga kala: 



Adana kala 


Visarga kala 


* Decreased digestive power. 

* Sun moving towards north. 

* Agni pradhanyakala. 

* Debilitating period.

* In hemanta rtu due to the cold breeze the body 
temperature is obstructed and enters deep into the body 
and increases digestive fire in the strong persons and able 
to digest hard food substances also. 

* If the proper food is not supplied to the body in winter, it 
might even burn body tissues. 

* Hence in winter it is advised to consume more snigdha 
(unctuous), madhura, amla and lavana rasa (sweet, sour 
and salt dravy as).

(Prevention of Diseases), thus said Atreya and other great sages. 

Preamble:

faeces, semen etc. and suppress the urges relating to rashness and evil deeds physically, 
mentally and orally.

Notes: 

Hot water: Basing on the variation of seasons like summer, winter, place of soil and also 
heaviness and lightness, hot water is to be prepared in the following ways: 

1. Ksinapada : Take 4 parts of water and boiled then reduced till 3 parts remained. 

2. Tribhaga : Water boiled and reduced to l/3rd of the original quantity. 

3. Ardhabhaga : Water boiled and reduced till the half of the quantity remained. 

4. Kvathita : Water boiled till the boiling point. 

Water heated by immersing red-hot iron balls, gold, silver, mud or bitumen with water, or by 
exposing to sunlight, either hot or cold, mitigates all the tridosas. 

Such water is easily digestible and is ideal for sarhsarga and sannipataja rogas. 

Boiled water lost the properties of dipana and pacana and increases all the tridosas, when 
stored for 2-3 days. Hence boiled water is to be prepared daily and should not be stored. 

Hot water is also having the similar properties of cold water like sweet in taste and cold in 
potency. Hence it is advisable to take hot water in thirst and fever. 

In amajlrna and vistabdha-ajirna also, hot water is advisable.

Water obtained from candmkante stones is sweet, cold and easily digestible which removes the 
evil spirits, vi$a disorders and also fevers caused by pitm do$a. 

Water which is boiled and cooled doesn't cause nbhi$ymdi and is easiy digestible and such 
water is wholesome in a condition where pitta is vitiated and associated with other dosas 
Where as the same stored over night (stale water) causes the aggravation of all the trido$a$*

* Cures skin disorders, diabetes, worm infestations, vomiting, dyspnoea, cough & diarrhoea. 

* Cleans and heals the wounds and unifies fractures. 

* Increases vata and mitigates kapha. 

Consists astringent and sweet in taste, dry and becomes pungent after digestion. 

Madhu sarkara: 

By keeping the honey in a bottle for few months, sedimentation will be formed. Such 
>edi mentation is called madhu sarkara, which is having the similar qualities of honey . 

* Honey should not be used after heating as the poisonous bees have collected it from various 
flowers that are having different tastes, qualities and potencies. 

* Hence the persons dominated by pitta constitution mixed with hot substances in summer 
season and the area where the temperature is so high should not use the honey as it (is not 
good for health) kills them quickly, similar to that of poison. 

But the honey can be used after heating in the therapeutic procedures like emesis and 
medicated enemata with decoctions as it comes out of the body quickly without undergoing 
digestion. 

Notes: 

* As the honey is hard to digest, dry, hot and astringent in taste, it should be used in smaller 
quantities. Higher doses leads to indigestion. 

* Generally to treat indigestion hot substances and hot water are to be given. But this general 
line of treatment is contrary to treat the indigestion, caused by excessive consumption of 
honey. Because hot water and hot substances should not be given with honey and the cold 
substances are unwholesome in indigestion. 

* Honey being a combination of different tastes, qualities and potencies, is the best 
yogavahi. Hence, when honey is used along with aphrodisiac drugs, it helps in the increase 
of sexual vigor. 

Types of honey : 

Honey is of 4 types and is good in the order of succession. 

1 . Bhraniara : Honey collected by the bees looks like large sized black carpenter bees and 

such honey is whitish in colour. 

2. Pauttika : Honey collected by yellowish big bees and the colour of honey resembles 

ghee. 

3. Ksaudra : Collected by small bees and the honey is dark brown in colour. 

4. Maksika : Honey collected by big sized honey coloured poisonous bees. The colour of

'Goumutra can cure kidney failure' 



EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE 

JANUARY 13 

AFTER her recovery from kid- 
ney failure with the help of 
'goumutra therapy/ 10-year-old 
Shalini Srivastava has started a 
mission to stop cow slaughter in 
the country. 

Speaking at a press meet, 
Shalini, a Patna resident, said she 
after she discovered she had kid- 
ney faiiure, she met several top 
doctors who suggested that she 
should be taken to Bangalore, 
where treatment would cost 
around Rs eight lakh. Unable to 
afford this treatment, she and her 



parents came to Kalikamata tem- 
ple in New E)elhi>vherc they met 
the temple priest. He advised her 
to take goumutra, and she began 
improving in a few days, the girl 
said. She recovered completely in 
a period of one month. She has 
ever since travelled nearly 6,251 
kms aH over the country to propa- 
gate the benefits of goumutra. She is 
presently in the city to protest cow 
slaughter at Deonar abattoir. 

According to Madhuben Joshi, 
who runs, a treatment centre at 
Ghatkopar, goumutra and other 
products are highly beneficial in 
the treatment of asthma, headache 
and even tooth problems.

In this way it was described in brief pertaining to various types of liquid substances like Toya 
varga, Ksira varga, Iksu varga, Taila varga, Madya varga, Mutra varga etc. in a systematic way. 

Thus ends the fifth chapter entitled Drava-dravya Viinaniya Adhyaya of 
Sutra Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Sarhhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Sirhhagupta. 

In the chapter Drava-dravya Vijnaniya, Acarya Vagbhata explained the different types of 
liquid substances and classified them chiefly under 7 groups as under: 

1 . Jala varga, 2. Ksira varga, 3. Iksu varga, 4. Madhu varga, 5. Taila varga, 6. Madya varga, 7. 
Mutra varga . 

Out of all these liquid substances, water is the most important one and so, it has been given the 
top priority. Though the group consists of various types of water, the entire water is ultimately 
of one type i.e. one which falls from the sky. Acarya Vagbhata classified the rainwater as 
gangambu and samudrodaka and then discussed the properties, test for the identification of the 
2 types of water, properties of the water, types of hot water etc. Then the group consisting 
different types of milk and milk products like curd, buttermilk, butter, ghee etc. their properties 
were explained. Sugarcane varieties, properties, jaggary, sugar etc. Honey — properties, types, 
different oils and alcohols and 8 types of urines and their properties etc have been detailed.

Different groups of food substances viz: suka varga, simbi varga. krtanna varga, maiiisa varga, 
saka varga, phala varga and medicinal substances in ousadha varga have been enumerated in 
brief, which are very much needful for everybody in their daily life. 



In the chapter Annasvarupa Vijnaniya, Acarya Vagbhata classified the food substances in to 7 
groups as — Suka varga, Simbi varga, Krtanna varga, Maiiisa varga, Saka varga, Phala varga 
and Ousadha varga. In suka varga different varieties of corns with bristles and their properties 
have been discussed. Among them rakta sali is superior and yavaka is inferior in their qualities. 
Different types of pulses like green gram, black gram, red gram, horse gram and their 
properties were discussed in simbi varga. Vagbhata stated that green gram is the best for 
preparation of dala and red gram for external application, black gram is not good among the 
pulses. Different types of food preparations like manda, peya, vilepi, yusa, maiiisa rasa etc. and 
their properties and indications were mentioned in krtanna varga. In marhsa varga 8 groups of 
animals like mrga, viskira, pratuda, vilesaya, prasaha, mahamrgajalacara and matsya and also 
their properties were discussed. In saka varga different types of leafy vegetables and other 
vegetables used in daily life have been discussed. In phala varga, draksa (grapes), dadima 
(pomegranate), plantain, dates, wood apple etc. have been discussed. Among them grapes are 
the best and likuca is the worst. In the end Vagbhata described some of the drugs useful as 
medicine in a separate group known as ousadha varga. Hence one must know the properties of 
various substances individually and the combination of other substances to get the desired 
effects. 




Thus ends the sixth chapter entitled Annaswarupa Vijnaniya Adhyaya of 
Sutra Sthana in Astariga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.

Annaraksa Adhyaya 

[Protection of Food Substances] 




After 'Annasvarupa Vijnaniyam, 9 Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter entitled 'Anna- 
raksa ' (Protection of Food Substances), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

In this chapter Vagbhata stressed the importance of protecting the food from poisoning and to 
whom it is necessary to make the food become poisonous, how to test the poisonous food, how 
to protect the food from poisoning and the preparation of various antitoxic formulations etc. 
have been discussed. 

Usually wealthy persons, landlords and kings will have more enemies rather than friends. So. 
there is every possibility of poisoning the food and other substances by the close associates of 
the lords and others, to kill them and snatch the wealth. 

Hence the lords should be cautious in this regard and appoint the royal physicians to look after 
their health and wealth. 

Appointment of pranacarya (Royal physician): 

<MI UMHJglU?) MIUIMl4fa^l^rlJfl4<ITr^c|r^cj Ucj?l yfriMflijfa: m II 

The king should arrange the residence for the royal physician very nearer to his palace so that 
he will be watchful in each and every aspect round the clock. 

Duties and responsibilities of pranacarya: 

34?IMM faNI*$f&^U| H$M^: I ift'l^tft rt<Nrft iwUll tlftM^HI: 112 II 

The foods and drinks taken by the kings should be carefully protected by the royal physicians 
from poisoning, because the security of the people, and attaining the four pursuits of life 
depends upon the healthiness and happiness of the lord. 

Notes: 

The author of Astariga Sarigraha has delineated the qualities of royal physician as under: 
Qualities of pra n acarya (Royal physician): 

* Royal physicians should have good family background. 

* Should be affectionate and friendly. 

* Having faith in God, soft in nature and should have good conduct and character. 

* Should be skillful. 



Annaraksa Adhyaya : 7 



139 



* Should take quick and firm decisions. 

* Should be pious physically, mentally and orally and be obedient. 

* Should not have any bad habits and should be courageous. 

* Perfectly trained in all eight branches of Ayurveda.

* Food mixed with poison will become thick and the grains of boiled rice cannot be 
separated. 

* It takes long time to cook. Even cooked, becomes moist and looses hotness in a short time.

Definition of viruddhahara: 

^f^f^l^Nyrck^^^^TlrHMI^d: 1145 II 

The food substances which dislodge the vitiated dosas from their places and unable to expel 
them out of the body and acts as antagonistic to the tissues are known as viruddhahara. 

Notes: 

Such drugs and diets are unwholesome for the normal tissue elements, which opposes in proper 
growth of the tissues; some act due to their mutually contradictory qualities; some by 
combination; some by the method of preparation; some by virtue of place, time and dose; some 
drugs by their inherent nature. 

1. Milk and horse gram taken together becomes incompatible due to the cold and hot in 
potency respectively. This is an example for mutually contradictory qualities. 

2. Milk and jackfruit should not be taken together. Even though both are having sweet in taste, 
cold in potency and becomes sweet at the end of digestion, the combination of these two 
becomes unwholesome. This is an example of incompatible food having similar qualities. 



146 



Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 



3. Milk and fish should not be taken together. Milk is sweet in taste, cold in potency and 
becomes sweet at the end of digestion where as fish also sweet in taste and becomes sweet at 
the end of digestion but hot in potency. This is an example of incompatible food having 
similar and dissimilar qualities. 

4. Curds should not be taken after heating. Eg. for method of preparation. 

5. Honey and ghee should not be taken in equal quantity. Eg. for dosage. 

6. Water obtained from saline soil is incompatible. Eg. for place. 

7. Saktu (flour made into thick solution with water) should not be taken in the night time. Eg. 
for time. 

8. Water should not be taken before and immediately after having saktu. Eg. for combination. 

9. Yavaka (small variety of barley) itself is incompatible due to the inherent nature. 

For an intelligent person the examples cited are enough to understand. By applying mind one 
can identify the various other incompatible foods and should avoid in taking such substances. 

Line of treatment: 

Complications arise due to the consumption of incompatible foods should be treated in the 
following ways. 

* Eliminate the vitiated dosas with emesis, purgation and other sodhana therapies. 

* Treat the complications by administering the drugs having opposite qualities. 

Aoettrftei ^cf VI A<Wlf^*$fr|: 1146 II 

Or make them accustomed to the body by the regular use of incompatible foods. 

o^Nmf^UjlkllPHc^ : ^^^ tl l r*^c4 ^ ^*HHJ 147ll 

In compatible foods do not cause harm to the persons doing regular exercises and taking 
unctuous substances, having increased digestive power, middle aged and strong persons. 
Similarly foods which have become accustomed and which are in lesser quantity are also not 
harmful. 

Notes: 

The use of incompatible foods causes boils, oedema, toxicity, abscess, tumor, tuberculosis, 
loss of vigor, strength, memory, intelligence, sense perceptions etc. and also asta-maharogas 
like jwara, raktapitta, vata-vyadhi, kusta, prameha, udara, bhagandaraand grahani. 

Even though regular intake of unwholesome foods, becoming wholesome, originally they are 
unwholesome. 

Hence it is instructed that accustomed incompatible food substances also should be discarded 
gradually in the following way.

incompatible foods and habits, which have become very close and vitiate the body to a great 
extent. 

Three secondary supporters of life:

Body is mainly supported by the acts performed in the previous life, which determine the 
present life span. 

The three secondary supporters of life are intake of food, sleep and observance of 
brahmacarya. They support the body constantly similar to the pillars supports a house. Being 
supported by these three well-regulated factors of life, the body is endowed with strength, 
complexion and growth, and continuous until the full span of life provided a person follows the 
regimen prescribed.

Ahara Nidra Brahmacarya 

Till now different types of food substances, liquids, solids, wholesomeness, unwholesomeness 
and their incompatibly etc. have been discussed. It is also will be described at the appropriate 
places. 

Here onwards regarding sleep and brahmacarya will be enumerated. 

Notes: 

Nidra (Sleep): 

Sleep was born at the time of commencement of the creation of the universe only, out of tamas. 

Sleep is another form of tamas and manifests due to the predominance of tamas generally in 
nights. 

Kapha will stirs up with the food substances and which obstructs the internal channels causes 
unable to perform normal functions of the sense organs due to exhaustion and thereby 
manifests sleep. 

When the mind gets exhausted or become inactive and the sensory and motor organs became 
inactive then the individual gets sleep. During sleep different kinds of dreams will be seen. 

Happiness and misery, nourishment and emaciation, strength and weakness, virility and 
sterility, knowledge and ignorance, life and death all these occur depending on the proper and 
improper sleep. 

^chi^^lriy^^ l^-q"^ fa^lcHI 1154 II 

Excessive, improper and sleeplessness leads to misery and also death similar to Kalaratri 
(Goddess of death). 

Effects of proper sleep: 

Proper sleep will make for happiness and long life just as the mind of the sages became clear 
from the knowledge of the soul.

Effects of vigil, day sleep & dosing:

* Vigil during night causes roughness, which leads to the vitiation of vata. 

* Day sleep increases the unctuous and thereby vitiation of kapha takes place. 

* Dosing in sitting posture does neither causes roughness nor unctuousness.

In summer season nights became shorter, and vata gets aggravated in the body due to the 
absorption of fluid, with its roughness. Hence sleep during daytime in summer is indicated. 
Day sleep in other seasons cause aggravation of kapha and pitta. 

Sleep during the daytime in all seasons is prescribed for those who are exhausted by excessive 
study. Riding vehicles, walking long distances, alcoholic drinks, sexual acts, carrying heavy 
loads, anger, grief and fear, dyspnoea, hiccough, diarrhoea, old persons, children, weak, 
emaciated, thirst, colic, indigestion, insane, habituated to sleep in day time etc. 

This maintains the equilibrium of dhatus and strength and kapha increases due to day sleep, 
which nourishes the organs and ensures longevity. 

Contraindications for day sleep:

One who desirous of long life should not have intercourse with a woman before the age of 
sixteen years and above seventy years.

perform intercourse otherwise dhatu ksaya takes place as the little quantity of the water in the 
pond dries up quickly with the sunrays. 

Similarly old persons above 70 years of age also should not copulate. If so, he collapses just as

intake of food, sleep and sexual intercourse; and there by diverting his mind towards spiritual 
rites and meditation will get utmost pleasure. These words are enough to a wise man to mould 
his life accordingly and can lead a healthy, happy and long life.

[Partaking Proper Quantity of Food] 



Matrasitiya Adhyaya 





After ' Annaraksa-vidhi Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Matrasitiya' (Partaking 
Proper Quantity of Food), thus aid Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

Matrasitiya consists two words viz. matra + asita. 

Matra means the quantity and asita represents the meaning for all the four types of food 
substances i.e. khadya, lehya,peyam<\ prasya. 

Hence matrasita means the quantity of food is to be taken. 

Quantity of food has been classified into two types namely pinda rilpa and pratidravyapeksita. 
As the quantity of food plays prominent role in the maintenance of positive health as well as the 
production of several diseases, it has been allocated a separate chapter by name Matrasitiya. 

Matra depends upon agni & drarya swabhava: 

MMIVII flcfchld HII-MNI £JH^: ycjfrfcbl I MNi 4o&||U4|l|$l^ y^Uijfa cHM^fa 111 II 

One should always consume proper quantity of food only why because consumption of 
appropriate quantity of food increases the power of digestion. 

Such quantity of food depends upon the nature of food substances, such as light and heavy. 

If the digestive power is more, high quantity of the food also can be digested and when the 
power of digestion decreases one cannot take more quantity of food. Similarly light articles of 
the food and are by nature even if taken in excess they are less harmful. On the other hand heavy 
foods are more harmful. Hence heavy food substances should be taken half of the capacity of 
the individual and the light food substances also should not be taken to his full satiation. 

In fact appropriate quantity of the food is that which is digested easily without causing any 
trouble to the body. 



In Astanga Saiigraha Sutra Sthana 1 1th chapter, features of proper quantity of food is more 
clearly delineated as under:

Features of inadequate quantity of food: 

* Consumption of inadequate quantity of food decreases body strength, growth and vigor. 

* Causes 80 types of vara disorders. 

Features of excessive quantity of food: . 

Intake of excessive quantity of food leads to the vitiation of all the tridosas at once and leads to 
alasaka, visucikatic.

Consumption of excessive food causes the sudden vitiation of the tridosas at a time, and which 
leads to the indigestion of the food material and produce diseases such as alasaka, by blocking 
the movement of food. The same if discharged through oral and anal orifices (vomitting and 
diarrhoea) is known as visucika.

156 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

Such indigested food moves neither upward nor downward direction, and stagnated in the 
stomach only by the obstruction of the vitiated dosas and causes pain. Such condition is known 
as alasaka. 

Clinical features of visucika: 

Due to the vitiation of dosas causes different kinds of discomforts in the body, especially the 
pain resembles in pricking with needles all over the body and the undigested food material 
comes out in the form of vomiting and diarrhoea in persons who are not having control while 
eating. It is known as visucika.

In the above conditions, due to the vitiation of: 

Vata: Colic pain, giddiness, abdominal distention, tremors, stiffness of the body etc. 

Pitta: Fever, diarrhoea, burning sensation inside the body, thirst, fainting etc. 

Kapha: Vomiting, heaviness in the body, loss of verbal communication, salivation etc. are the 

symptoms observed.

Due to the excessive consumption of food by the persons who are weak, having poor digestive 
capacity, vitiated by kapha and in the suppression of natural urges — leads further aggravation 
of vata which obstructs the internal channels along with kapha causes all the above symptoms 
except vomiting and diarrhoea.

Due to the obstruction of the channels, the vitiated dosas are unable to move in the upward or 
downward direction and begin to move in the side ward direction and makes the body stiff like 
a stick and can be called dandalasaka, which is incurable and should be discarded for giving 
treatment. 

Ama visa: 



Matrasitiya Adhyaya : 8 157 

Due to the ingestion of unwholesome food, excessive food and also the food taken, before the 
previous meals get digested, ama converts into amavisa. Whenever ama transformed into 
amavisa it will get all the 1 0 qualities of the poison ( visa). 

Hence it is difficult to manage amavisa due to the contradictory line of treatment for ama and 
sa such as usna and sita cikitsa respectively .

* Sweeten (sudation therapy). 

* Phala varti for the downward movement of mala and vata. 

* Rigid parts should be fomented and then wrap it with a piece of cloth. 

Treatment for visucika: 

* In the advanced stage of visucika, the best line of treatment is conducting agnikarma over 
heal region and advised the patient to go for fasting on that day. 

* Follow the post-operative regimen (samsarjana krama) similar to virecana karma

* When dosas vitiate excessively, expulsion is the only way to root out them from their 
origin. 

Notes: 

Types of apatarpa n a (Langhana): 
Apatarpana {langhana) is of 3 types viz. 

1 . Langhana (fasting). 

2. Langhana-pacana (fasting & digestive drugs). 

3. Dosavasecana (elimination). 

(a) Langhana (Fasting): 

Langhana is indicated when the dosas are mild, just as the little amount of water in a tank 
absorbed by the wind and sun, the mild vitiated dosas also comes to normal with the help of 
fasting, which increases the power of digestion as well as samana vata in the body. 

(b) Langhana-pacana (Fasting & digestive drugs): 

Both fasting and digestive drugs are indicated when the dosas gets aggravated moderately. 

To dry up the tank which contains medium quantity of water some dust and sand also required 
along with the above factors like wind and sun. Similarly both fasting and digestive drugs are 
essential to manage moderately vitiated dosas. 

(c) Do s avasecana (Elimination therapy): 

When dosas are high, expulsion is the only way, just as the crops in a field don't grow well, 
unless the excessive water drained out. 

Hetu-viparita & vyadhi-viparita cikitsa: 

* Fasting and digestive drugs are useful for the management of the diseases originated due to

creating. The same line of treatment i.e. hetu-viparyaya cikitsa (opposite of their 
c iusative factors) can be adopted to treat other diseases also. 

If the disease is not cured due to the above line of treatment, then follow vyadhi-viparyaya 
tsa (opposite to the disease). 

ayarthakari cikitsa: 

x Or adopt ubhayarthakari cikitsa, which is neither against the cause nor disease. 

When dosas are devoid of arna and the digestive power is improved adopt the following 

therapeutic procedures.

Thus ends the eighth chapter entitled Matrasitiya Adhyaya of SQtra Sthana in 
Astariga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya Vagbhata son of 
Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta. 

In this chapter Matrasitiya, Acarya Vagbhata explained the definition of proper quantity of 
food and their features. Qualities of light and heavy food substances, types of improper 
quantity of food, inadequate, excessive quantity; their complications and treatment were 
discussed. Amadosa, treatment, etc., food taken in proper quantity helps in bringing about the 
strength, complexion, happiness and longevity whereas the improper food leads all sorts of 
tridosas in the human beings. Three types of food to be discarded viz. samasana, adhyasana, 
visamasana. Rules and regulations of taking food, postprandial drinks — advantages and cotra- 
indications and at the end recommended time to eat etc. have been discussed. 



9Dravyadi Vijnaniya 
Adhyaya 

[Knowledge of Rasa Pahcaka] 



After 'Matrasitiya Adhyaya 9 Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter ' Dravyadi-vijnaniya ' 
(Knowledge of Rasa Pancaka), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

Basic concepts of the drug were not touched so far. Hence a separate chapter has been allocated 
to discuss the basics such as rasa, guna, virya, vipaka and prabhava as under. 

Importance, nature and origin of dravya: 

^nfa"TOT^RT &g,^f^<T^T3RT: I M^^dlrMcb dTj$*TT*Tfli8iq 111 II 

a^iMPHMcHH'Mfli «Mc||tM: I dfa<£faf^M&c^M^I^ ^HFTT 112 II 

* Dravya (substance) is the chief component among rasa, guna, virya, vipaka etc. as it is 
providing shelter to the latter. 

* All the substances in the universe are composed with pahca mahabhutas. Prthivi is its 
subtratum and ap (udaka) or water is its origin, akasa, vayu and tejas are its other 
supporting parts. 

* The inseparable concomitance of prthivi and the other basic elements causes the origin of 
the substances as well as peculiarity among them. In the formation of shape-aMsa 
mahabhuta; for causing hardness- vayu mahabhuta; germinating parts of the plants-te/a 
mahabhuta; origin of the drugs-ap mahabhuta; substratum-prt/?iV/ mahabhuta etc. plays 
the prominent role. 

* In this way the inseparable combination of all these 5 basic elements are responsible for the 
formation of all the drugs as well as diet. 

Rasa (Taste): 

dJotlTfeh^UJ: fchf^<-rl otlrblsftr ^«4^ I 'JUII £oi| Tjfaoiildfl <<HI3T^ 114 II 

All the substances in the universe are composed with pahca mahabhutas and no substance is 
formed with only one maha bhuta. Similarly diseases are also manifested due to the vitiation of 
the tridosas. 

Eg: Parthiva dravya means that the drug which is predominantly consisting of prthivi 




Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 



167 



mahabhuta along with the other four. Madhura rara dravya means the drug which is 
predominantly sweet in taste along with the other five. Similarly vata jwara means the fever 
caused due to the vitiation of vata predominantly and associated with the other two dosas. 

Rasa and anurasa (Primary and secondary tastes): 

In a substance rasa (primary/main taste) is clearly perceptible where as the anurasa (secondary 
taste) is not perceptible due to the dominance of primary taste or slightly perceptible at the end. 

Rasa has been described by having the qualities of the guru, laghu, sita, usna etc. But strictly 
speaking these are the qualities of the basic elements, which are present in the substance. It is 
only a categorical attribution and should not be taken as actual position. It is the quality of the 
>ubstance but not of rasas. 

Parthiva dravya guna: 

* The drugs that are having the qualities of guru (heavy), sthula 
(bulky), sthira (immobile) and also having the predominance of 
gandhaguna (smell) can be called as parthiva dravyas. 

* Those drugs are responsible for the weight, firmness, steadiness and 
also the development of the body. 

Jaliya (apya) dravya guna: 

3JIU4 ^gHf^W|^ck^<y^l^^4^l 

* The drugs that are having the qualities of drava (liquid), sita (cold), 
guru (heavy), snigdha (unctuous), manda (dull), sandra (thick) and 
having the predominance of rasa guna (taste) can be called as jaliya 
dravyas. 

* These drugs will produce unct-uousness, secretions, moistness, 
contentment and bindingness (holding together) in the body. 

Sgneya dravya guna: 

3H^W ^I^^WufychlVIM^HIrMchH^I 

* The substances that are having the qualities of ruksa (dry), tiksna 
(sharp), usna (hot), vi&ada (non slimy), suksma (minute) and also 
having the predominance of rupaguna (vision) are known as agneya 
dravyas. 




Prthivi 




Jala 




Agni 



* These are responsible for burning, brightness, complexion and color, digestion etc. 




168 



Astanga Hrdayam : Sut ra-sthana 




Vayaviya dravya guna: 

* The drugs that are having the qualities of ruksa (dry), visada (non 
slimy), laghu (light), and also having the predominance of sparsa guna 
(touch) are known as vayavya dravyas. 

* These drugs are responsible for dryness, lightness, non-sliminess, 
weakness and division in the body. I 

Akasiya dravya guna: 
ffiRi4HiMcicMHr 

* The drugs that are having the qualities of suksma (minute), visada 
(non-slimy), laghu (light) and also having the dominance of sabda 
guna (sound) are known as akasa dravyas. 

* They are responsible for hollowness and lightness in the body. 
All the substances are medicines: 

Nothing exists in the world that is non-medicinal. That means all the substances available in 
the universe are useful for treatment in either way. 

Dominance of mahabhuta and the drug action: 

* The drugs abounding with the qualities of agni and vayu have a tendency of upward 
movement. This is because of the lightness and upward mobile nature of vayu and upward 
flames of agnL 

* The drugs abounding with the qualities of prthi V/and apon the other hand have a tendency 
of downward movement because of the heaviness of prthi viand downward flow of jala. 

Thus ends the description of dravya. Detailed classification of rasas will be discussed in the 
forthcoming chapter Rasa-bhediya Adhyaya. 



Akasa 



Virya 

(Potency) 



Astavidha virya: 

<M ^Hcf<-ri)^ iU^f^^ 111 211 



Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 169 

According to some medical authorities virya has been classified into 8 types: 

1. Guru (Heavy) 5. Laghu (Light) 

2. Snigdha (Unctuous) 6. Ruksa(Dry) 

3. Hima/Sita(Co\&) 7. Usna(Y\oi) 

4. Mrdu (soft) 8. Tiksna (Sharp) 

Opinion of Caraka on virya: 

Virya is nothing but the potency of the drugs. Maharsi Caraka opines that all these actions of 
the drugs like elimination, mitigation etc are influenced by the potency of the drugs and 
without having potency no drug will show its action. 

Doctrine of eight-fold poteney:

fWJJ'pmi^ $Mck^rcbtffcHf^ , c^KW ^^rc<lc{^i4i^U||cjfa 111 5 II 

Reasons for giving the designation of virya to guru and other gunas: 

* As guru and the other seven qualities (total eight) have been mentioned predominantly. 

* As they have been attributed in many a number of drugs. 

* As they were mentioned in Ayurveda prior to rasa and others. 

* As they are potent in comparison with rasas and the rest of gunas. 

3Trr^(^M(lrlrc(irH^^r^r^ ^"^T if^^Mr) <*H^, <M J J°lf^ 111 6 II 

Rasa and other 12 qualities cannot consider as virya because they are having the opposite 
reasons mentioned in the above text. 

In this way eight types of potencies have been described by some acaryas. 

Out of the twenty, the eight qualities mentioned here are only those, which are capable of over 
coming the effects of rasa, and the other twelve are not contradicting the effects of rasa. 

Hence the above eight types of qualities of the drugs only can be identified as the potency of the 
drugs. 

For e.g. the effect of the pungent taste in pippali could normally be the aggravation of pitta, but 
by virtue of mrduguna and sita virya, pippali alleviates rather than aggravates pitta. 

The effect of bitter and astringent tastes in pancamula usually should aggravate vata, but due to 
the hot in potency they are alleviating vata. 

Two types of virya: 



170 



Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 



Generally virya is of 2 types viz. ( 1 ) usna virya and (2) sita virya. 

The qualities such as guru, laghu etc. and the seasons like debilitating and nourishing periods 
are having the predominance of only two elements agni (hot) and soma (cold). So, virya is also 
of 2 kinds — hot and cold, even though the substances are having many qualities in them, heat 
and cold are more powerful than all others and the rest are within the scope of these two only. 

* Usually the drugs containing katu, amla and lav ana rasas are predominantly having usna 
virya in their succeeding order. 

* Similarly tikta, kasaya, madhura rasa dravyas are predominantly having sita virya in their 
succeeding order. 

* The potency of the drugs and diets can be ascertained while they are in association with the 
body and are immediately after they come in contact with the body. For example hot 
potency of meat of marshy animals is ascertained while it is under the process of digestion, 
where as the sharpness of marica can be determined immediately after its contact with the 
tongue. 

Effects of usna and sita virya dravya: 

^^qmchM^: cbilfri, R)|f$K ^H: i^ltH *flcM W^T M<HK *rbftM4h 111 911 

* Usna virya drugs are responsible for dizziness, thirst, fatigue, sweating, burning, rapid 
digestion and mitigation of vata and kapha in the body. 

* Where as sita virya dravyas cause happiness, supporting life, obstruction/withhold and 
purification of rakta and pitta. 

Vipaka 

(Taste after Digestion) 

*1l<Au||pHl iflMia^fa <UM<HJ<UMi MRu||*4l^faMlcb$fa *4jd: 1120 II 

After the intake of drugs or diet having different tastes gets digested by the digestive enzymes 
and undergo transformation in the form of another taste is known as vipaka. 

It is of three types: 

1 . Madhura vipaka 2 . Amla vipaka 3 . Katu vipaka 

Vipakaja rasabheda: 

Generally, the substances having madhura and lavana rasa (sweet and saline in taste) will be 
transformed into madhura vipaka after getting digested. Amla rasa dravyas (sour substances) 
will be transformed into amla vipaka while the drugs having katu, tikta and kasaya rasa 
(pungent, bitter and astringent taste substances) will be transformed into katu vipaka. 



Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 171 

Generally the effects of rasa and vipaka are similar to one another. That means the substances 
having madhura, amla and katu vipaka will act according to the taste of those substances in 
most of the cases. 

Drug action depends on either rasa, guna, virya, vipaka or prabhava: 

Some drugs will act by their tastes, some others by their qualities, some by their potency some 
other by vipaka and still others by their special effect known as prabhava. 

Powerful one only comes into action among rasa etc: 
ii^l^otl «Mc|t^H c|<ft U23I! 

Among the different factors such as taste, quality, potency etc. whichever is more powerful 
that makes the actions of others insignificant. In case of co-existence of opposing factors the 
weaker one is overlooked by the stronger and comes into force. 

Natural order of strength of rasa and others: 

When rasa, vipaka, virya and prabhavas are in equal strength, vipaka defeats rasa, vipaka and 
rasa together defeated by virya, prabhava defeats all of them. This is the natural order of 
strength. 

* Eg. honey consists of madhura rasa and katu vipaka. Though madhura rasa is capable to 
mitigate vata due to the dominance of katu vipaka it is increasing vata. Here the rasa is 
dominated by vipaka. 

* Even though the meat of buffalo is having madhura rasa and madhura vipaka they will be 
dominated by usna virya and aggravates pitta. 

* Similarly sura, a type of wine containing amla rasa, amla vipaka and usna virya, they were 
dominated by prabhava and acts as a galactogogue. 

Prabhava 

(Specific Action) 

Where there is similarity in two drugs in relation to their rasa, vipaka and virya but in spite of 
this similarity these two drugs differ in their action. The distinctive feature responsible for their 
distinctive effects not supported by their rasa, vipaka and virya is considered as prabhava or 
specific action. 

Eg. both citraka (Plumbago zeylanica) and da/?f/(Balliospermum montanum) are katu rasa, 
katu vipaka and usna virya. But, in spite of this similarity danti acts as a purgative while citraka 



172 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

creates constipation. Similarly draksa and yastimadhu are having similar properties; draksa 
acts as a laxative while yasti causes constipation. 

Though ghee and milk are having madhura rasa, sita virya and madhura vipaka, ghee increases 
the power of digestion whereas milk doesn't. 

Vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya: 

Till now the general mode of action of the drugs has been described. In addition there is a 
special category of substances known as vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya. 

Eg. even though both wheat and barley are having madhura rasa and guru guna, wheat 
mitigates vata where as barley aggravates vata. 

Though milk and fish are having madhura rasa and guru guna, their virya is differed with one 
another as sita and usna respectively. 

Similarly meat of lion and boar are also having madhura rasa and guru guna. Boar's meat will 
be transformed into madhura vipaka at the end of the digestion, as it is samana pratyayarabdha 
dravya. Whereas lion's meat is transformed into katu vipaka as it is vicitra pratyayarabdha 
dravya. 

Thus ends the ninth chapter entitled Dravyadi Vijnamya Adhyaya of Sutra 
Sthana in Astariga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta. 

In the chapter Dravyadi Vijnamya, Acarya Vagbhata explained the basic concepts of 
Dravyaguna such as rasa, guna, virya, vipaka, prabhava etc. Definition of rasa, actions, 
qualities of 5 kinds of substances parthiva, jaliya etc. Definition of virya, different types of 
vipaka and prabhava. Samana pratyayarabdha dravya, vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya etc. have 
been discussed in detail.

After 'Dravyadi Vijnanlya Adhyaya 9 Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Rasabhediya ' 
(Different Types of Rasa and Their Combinations), thus said Lord Atreya and other sages. In 
this chapter Vagbhata discussed the various types of rasas and their combinations. 

Sweet, sour, salt, bitter, pungent and astringent is the six-fold combination of the taste and are 
giving better nourishment to the body in their preceding order. 

Rasa-utpatti (Formation of tastes): 

Rasa or taste of the drugs and diet can be ascertained immediately f i 
after their contact with the tongue. 

Rasa is the object of gustatory sense organ. Primarily ap and prthivi 
constitute the substratum for the manifestation of rasa and the other 
three basic elements viz. akasa,vayu and tejas are only efficient 
causes of the manifestation of the specific qualities of the taste. Rasa 

The taste does not manifest itself while the water is in the atmosphere. As soon as it starts 
falling on the ground it comes in contact with the atoms of five basic elements impelled by the 
atmosphere itself and there comes the first stage of the manifestation of the rasa. The 
culminating point of this manifestation is however reached when the water falls on the ground 
and it comes in contact with the individuals of plant and animal kingdom. At this stage the six 
tastes manifests themselves in the individuals. Different seasons also play an important role, in 
the manifestation of tastes by the combination of the basic elements in different proportions. 

Relationship of pa ilea mahabhutas with the tastes: 

Madhura and other rasas will be formed due to the predominance of two, two mahabhutas as

Thus ends the tenth chapter entitled Rasabhediya Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana in 
Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya Vagbhata son of 
Sri Vaidyapati Sirhhagupta. 

In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata explained the definition of rasa and the formation of six tastes 
in a substance. 

Then the features of different tastes, actions and the complications due to excessive use of such 
substances and some of the substances pertaining to the group of all the six tastes have been 
presented. At the end 63 combinations of the tastes have been enumerated. 

Such combination and types are enunciated because they are useful in connection with 
maintenance of health and cure of diseases.

aggravation, those in the state of diminution gave up their normal signs and symptoms and 
those in a state of equilibrium operate properly. Hence it is very much essential to know the 
features of dosa, dhatu and malas of normal, abnormal and below normal levels, so that the 
drug and diet of different types, which have been already studied in the previous chapters, can 
be utilized to maintain the equilibrium.

* If the opposite qualities of dosa, dhatu and- malas decreases in the body, it can be inferred 
that those dosa, dhatu or malas are increased in the body. 

* Similarly the opposite qualities of dosas etc. increases in the body, that means the 
concerned dosas are decreased. 

* For eg. — the opposite qualities of vata like unctuousness, heaviness and hotness decreases 
in the body means vata is increased. 

* Unctuousness, heaviness and hotness increased in the body infers that vata is decreased. 

* Accumulation of waste products in the body indicates the increase of malas and the 
excessive elimination suggests the decrease of malas. 

Accumulation of malas in the body is natural. Their decrease causes harm to the body. Hence 
decreased quantity of malas is more harmful than the accumulation.

There is a definite relationship between dosas and dhatus because all the substances in the 
universe are formed by the five basic elements only.

Asraya 


Vata 
Pitta 
Kapha 


Asthidhatu 
Rakta and sveda 

Rasa, maihsa, meda, majja, sukra and mala-mutra. 



* Vata resides in asthi dhatu, pitta in rakta and sweda where as kapha resides in the rest of 
dhatus. viz. rasa, mamsa, medas, majja, sukra, mala and mutra. 

The causative factors which are responsible for the increase and decrease of the asrayis 
(dosas) also causes to increase and decrease of asrayas (dhatu and malas) respectively 
except in the case of vata. 

That means: 

* The factors responsible for the increase of pitta, also increases rakta and sweda, and vice 
versa. 

* Similarly, the factors which increases kapha also increases rasa, maihsa, meda, majja, 
sukra, mala, mutra and vice versa. 

* But the factors which increases vata, doesn't increase asthidhatu, moreover it decreases. 

* Similarly those factors increasing asthi causes diminishing of vata. 

* Generally the increases of all dhatus are due to over nutrition and predominance of kapha. 

* Nourishing therapy increases kapha and all other dhatusbul reduces vata. 

* Reducing therapy decreases all the dhatus and increases vata. 

* Hence the diseases caused by increase or decrease of dhatus is to be treated with reducing 
or nourishing therapies respectively except in vata. 

* In all the cases the use of substances, qualities and actions either opposite or similar but not 
antagonistic to the dhatus is to be planned appropriately. 

Notes: 

Causes for increase/decrease of the tissues and the treatment: 

* The body tissues generally increases by the use of foods and activities which are similar or 
possessing similar properties, they undergo decrease by the use of food and activities 
which are opposite or possessing opposite properties. 

* The dhatus which are heavy, undergo increase by the use of the substances having similar 
properties of heaviness, similarly the dhatus which are light, undergo increase by the use of 
light substances. By the use of opposite substances they undergo decrease. 

* The substances, which are materially similar causes the increase rapidly. 



194 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

• Rakta dhatu increases rapidly by the use of the blood. 

• Marhsa dhatu increases rapidly by the use of ingestion of meat. 

• Medo dhatu increases rapidly by the use of muscle fat. 

• Asthi dhatu increases rapidly by the use of bones. 

• Majja dhatu increases rapidly by the use of bone-marrow. 

• Sukra dhatu increases rapidly by the use of semen or eggs. 

* The substances possessing similar qualities may not present near by or not available (or) 
though available may not be suitable to the individuals (or) being unwholesome (or) 
causing aversion (or) tastelessness (or) due to any other reason it is the best to make use of 
the substances possessing similar properties. 

Eg. — in the condition of sukra dhatu-ksaya , the use of milk, ghee and other substances 
possessing sweet in taste, unctuousness and cold in potency are indicated.

9. Due to the increase of urine • Treatment of diabetes. 

10. Due to the decrease of sweat • Body massage, exercise, alcohol, sleep, staying in 

the air tight rooms and other sudation therapeutic 
techniques. 

Reason for the increase or decrease of body tissues: 

Dhatwagni is nothing but the part or share of jatharagni (digestive power), which is present in 
side of all the sapta dhatus. This is also another factor responsible for the increase or decrease 
of bodily tissues due to the debility and intensity of the dMfw^gmrespectively. 

Though the forest fire (davagni) is continuously burning, gets flared up greatly at certain times 
and decreased at other times, depending upon the nature of the fuel available. So also the 
transformation of tissues undergoes increase or decrease depending upon nature of food 
substances. 

Substances, which are similar or dissimilar to the dhatus, are the causes for their increase or 
decrease respectively because each one has its own specific action in quickly transforming 
them. 

Dosa, d hat ii, mala & sroto-dusti: 

<{tal $El ^^f^l^^^^HIHJISSII 

Dosas gets vitiated due to the irregular diet and activities. Afterwards they vitiate the dusyas 
and they in turn vitiate malas. Such vitiated malas further vitiates the malayana (anus, urethral 
passage, mouth, ears, eyes and nostrils) and causes diseases.

The person who dislikes such substances should be avoided and shows interest in such 
substances should be made available. So that the diseases caused by the vitiation of various 
dosas can be managed. 

Reason for paying the interest and haterdness of substances: 

cf^f|*>R4 <{lNI IcWfldfWMifl: IcngT: $ffalT2J oT$T^fSTfOT*«J^T 1143 II 

If the dosas are in the increased state, the person wishes to take the substances, which are 
having exactly opposite in nature of such dosas. Similarly if they are in decreased state, the 
person wishes to take the food having the similar qualities to that of the diminished dosas. By 
knowing the above fact it is easy to know the vitiation i.e. either increase or decrease of the 
dosas, but the unintelligent persons are unable to recognize status of dosas. 

Action of dosas according to their state:

Dosadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 11 197 

Whenever the dosas increase they amplify their respective features depending upon their 
strength. Similarly if they decrease, their functions are also diminishing. If they are in the 
balanced state they will attend their normal functions. 

Keep dosas under control: 

The same dosas whenever they are in the normal state causes for the proper growth and 
development of the body. But whenever they are in the imbalanced state i.e. either increased or 
decreased state causes the destruction of the body. Hence one should be cautious and protect 
the dosas without undergoing any abnormal changes by adopting wholesome diet and deeds.

Thus ends the eleventh chapter entitled Dosadivijnamya Adhyaya of Sutra 
Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Sarhhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Sirhhagupta. 

In the chapter Dosadi Vijhaniyam Acarya Vagbhata expressed that dosa, dhatu and malas are 
the constituents of the body and imbalanced state of those are responsible for the production of 
various disorders. The basic principles of the treatment is to bring back the normal state of the 
dosas either increased or decreased by applying samanya-visesa siddhanta. Hence it is very 
much essential to know the normal functions and the features of the increased or decreased 
state of dosa, dhatu and malas. After that dosa, dhatu and malas relationship {asrayasrayi 
bhava) was discussed. At the end definition of ojas, features, importance, causes for 
diminution and their signs & symptoms, and also the treatment was explained.

* Increase of the dosas in their own places is known as caya. 

* In that condition, the persons gets aversion towards the diet and regimen which are 
responsible for the increase of the dosas and develop the desire to have the opposite 
qualities of those of diet and regimen. 



Prakopa (Great increase):

* Dosas gets further increase (vitiation) and spreads in the other parts of the body by leaving 
from their original place is known as prakopa. 

* In such condition, the vitiated dosas manifest their abnormal symptoms and results in the 
occurrence of diseases. 

Prasama (Normalcy): 

Equilibrium state of dosas in their original places is known as prasama. 
Notes: 

* Just as the clouds are brought together at one place by the wind and made to rain, the 
aggravated dosas produce diseases either in the whole part of the body, half of it, in any one 
organ being brought there by the influence of vata. 

* The vitiated dosas causes troubles to the body by producing various types of diseases. 
Among them, 80 are produced by vata, 40 are due to pitta and 20 by the vitiation of kapha.

•ith the prefix of the name of the organ, which they affect. For eg. nakha bheda, sankha bheda, 
hlata bheda, antardaha etc. The diseases, which are not mentioned in the text also can be 
known by the features of the dosas and can be treated according to the general line of treatment. 

Relationship between dosas and seasons: 



Dosa 


Chaya 


Prakopa 


Prasama 


Vata 
Pitta 
Kapha

Varsa 

Sisira 


Varsa 
Sarad 
Vasanta 


Sarad 

Hemanta 

Grisma 



In grisma rtu, generally all the drugs and diet are light and dry. As the vata also having the 
similar qualities, vata undergoes caya (mild increase) only, but not prakopa (further 
aggravation) merely because of the hotness of the season. The vata (samirana), which, 
^cumulates in grisma rtu, will be aggravated in varsa rtu due to its coldness and subsides 
automatically in sarad rtu. 

In varsa rtu, pitta undergoes only caya, because of the food substances that are used possess 
nulla vipika, but not prakopa mearly because of the coldness of the season. The pitta, which 
accumulates in varsa rtu, will be aggravated in sarad rtu and subsides automatically in hemanta 
rtu. 

In sisira rtu, kapha undergoes only caya by the use of food substances, which are unctuous, cold 
etc. that are similar to the dosa. Kapha becomes solidified by the effect of season and doesn't 
undergo prakopa. Kapha become liquified in vasanta rtu and gets aggravated, and subsides 
automatically in grisma rtu.

* The above changes of the dosas will be taken place naturally by the influence of the 

seasons. 

* Accumulation, aggravation and normalcy of the dosas will be taken place instantaneously 
by the diet and activities without observing the influence of seasons.

Vitiated dosas cause various types of innumerable diseases like jwara and others and is 
responsible for making uneasiness in the body. It is not possible to describe all aspects of each 
and every disease condition minutely and hence common factors responsible for the 
production of diseases, their signs and symptoms and the general line of treatment is being 
delineated. 

Dosa-vaisamya is the chief cause for the manifestation of all diseases:

All the endogenous diseases occur invariably due to the vitiation of vata, pitta and kapha. As 
the bird cannot transgress its own shadow even though flying throughout the day, just as all the 
things of the universe cannot exist apart from the trigunas (sattwa, rajas and tamas), so also no 
endogenous disease caused by the disturbance of the equilibrium of the dhatus can occur 
without the vitiation of tridosas.

In total, there are only the three causative factors, which are responsible for the production of 
the diseases, viz. 

1 . Asatmyendriyartha samyoga (Improper correlation of sense organs with their objects). 

2. Prajnaparadha (Intellectual blemish). 

3 . Parinama (Effects of time) . 

Each of them is again of 3 types: 

(a) A tiyoga (Excessive); 

(b) Ayoga (Inadequate); 

(c) Mithy ayoga (Perversion).

obj ects sound, touch, vision, taste and smell respectively is known as asatmyendriyartha 
samyoga. 

(a) Atiyoga: Excessive utilisation of sense organs with their objects is known as atiyoga. 
Ex. seeing the objects for a long time. Perception of tastes excessively. Smelling the 
substances excessively.

(c) Mithyayoga : Rains in summer and hotness in winter etc. 

3. Karma/Prajnaparadha (Intellectual blemish): 



All the three kinds of unwholesome actions pertaining to body, speech and mind is known as 

prajhaparadha. 

(a) Atiyoga : Too much indulgence in such action is atiyoga, 

(b) Ayoga : Very little or no action is ayoga. 

(c) Mithyayoga : Wrong utilisation of mental faculties is known as mithyayoga.

The above three causative factors are responsible for the vitiation of all the dosas and which 
they in turn produces all the three pathways of the diseases pertaining to sakha {bahya 
rogamarga), kostha {abhyantara rogamarga) and asthi sandhis {madhyama rogamarga).

* Raktadayastwak ca i.e. blood and the rest of other tissues and the skin form to the exterior 
pathway of the diseases. It is also known as sakha. 

* Diseases such as masa (mole), vyanga (hyperpigmentation) ganda (goitre), alaji(a type of 
ascess; painful, copper coloured and pointed boil), arbuda (tumor), bahirbhaga durnama 
(external piles), gulma (lumps), sopha (oedema) etc. are related to bahya rogamarga.

* Kostha is the central part of the body. Maha srotas, sarira madhya, mahanimna, 
amapakvasayasraya (amasaya and pakvasaya) etc. are synonyms for kostha. This is the 
internal pathway of the diseases. 

* Diseases such as chardi (vomiting), atisara (diarrhoea), kasa (cough), swasa (dyspnoea), 
udara (abdominal disease with distension), jwara (fever), antarbhaga-sopha (internal- 
odema), arsas (internal piles), gulma (internal lumps), visarpa (cellulitis), vidradhi 
(internal abscess) etc. are related to abhyantara rogamarga.

* The vital organs head, heart and the bladder etc., the joints of the bones, include the bones 
joined together by the ligaments and tendons attached there to form to the middle pathway 
of the diseases. 

* Diseases such as yaksma (tuberculosis), paksavadha (hemiplegia), ardita (facial 
paralysis), murdhadi roga (diseases pertaining to head, heart, bladder are other vital 
organs), sandhi-sula (joint pains), asthi-sula (pain in the bones), trika-sula (pain in the 
sacrum), sandhi-asthi-trika graha (rigidity in the joints, bones and sacral region) etc. are 
related to madhyama rogamarga. 

Features of increased vata: 

Vitiated dosascm be recognised by observing the following features: 

Sramsa (drooping), vyasa (dilation), vyadha (piercing pain), svapa (numbness), sada (fatigue), 
rwAr(pain), toda (pricking pain), bheda (splitting pain), sanga (obstruction of urine and faeces), 
angabhahga (throbbing of body parts), sahkoca (contractions), varta (rolling or twisting), 
harsana (horripilations), tarsana (thirst), kampa (tremors), parusya (roughness), sausirya 
(porosity), sosa (wasting), spandana (pulsating), vestana (compressing pain), stambha 
(stiffness) kasaya rasata (astringent test in the mouth), syavaruna varna (blackish red 
discoloration of the skin) etc. are the features of increased vata.

Till now the signs and symptoms of vitiated dosas have been enumerated. Physician must be 
known all these things through various investigation techniques viz. darsana (inspection), 
sparsana (palpation) and prasna (interrogation). 

In order to gain the appropriate knowledge pertaining to various stages of the disease, 
physician must observe the patient constantly. 

Importance of practical knowledge:

Knowledge pertaining to precious metals and gems can be obtained through constant 
observation of various types of metals and gems. Simply by textual knowledge one cannot 
identify the good and bad ones. Similarly along with theoretical knowledge practical 
knowledge is equally essential to become a successful practitioner.

2. Purvaparadhaja/Purvakarmaja (caused by the activities of previous lives).

Dosabhediya Adhyaya : 12 209 

a) Do s ottha vyadhi: 

These are the diseases caused due to non-observance of wholesome diet and regimen and 
simultaneously adopting the unwholesome diet and regimen. 

Hence the diseases caused by the vitiation of dosas are having the visible causative factors. 

b) Karmaj a vyadhi: 

These are the diseases caused by the sinful acts of the previous life and are having exactly 
opposite qualities of dosottha rogas and are having the invisible causative factors. 

< c ) Do s akarmaja vyadhi: 

Eventhough the visible causative factors are less and causing dreadful diseases are known as 
dosakarmaja vyadhi or combination of both the above. 

Line of treatment for the above three types of diseases: 

* In the above diseases, dosottara vyadhi is caused due to vitiation of dosas only. Hence the 
opposite qualities of drug, diet and regimen are to be adopted to manage such diseases. 

* The diseases caused by providence (actions of past life) will be relieved only after the 
effect of such actions, comes to an end, inspite of the use of opposites. 

* Dosa karmaja vyadhis will be cured by the diminution of both the effects. 

Dwividha roga (Two types of diseases): 

fi^T*rcT?r5rrcn^^ ii60 ii 

In another way diseases have been classified into 2 types viz. 

1 . Svatantra roga (Primary diseases) 

2. Paratantraroga (Secondary diseases) 

Svatantra-parantantra roga (Primary and secondary diseases): 

* The diseases manifest either as the chief one or associated with another disease are known 
as svatantraand paratantra respectively. 

* Svatantra rogas are also- known as anubandhya vyadhi, which are independent, and here 
specific well defined signs and symptoms and also specific causative factors and the line of 
treatment is available. 

Diseases, which are secondary are of 2 kinds: 

(a) Pi/ro£a/n/(Manifested prior to the primary disease). 

(b) An ugaml (Manifested after the primary disease). 

Purogami: It is also known as purvarupa i.e. premonitory symptoms. 

Anugami: It is called upadrava or complications. They generally subside with the cure of the 
primary diseases. 



210 




?IHU¥IIUMW«U 1162 II 



* When they don't subside they should be treated after treating the primary diseases 
generally. But when they are acute and powerful, treat the complications first and then go 
for treating the primary diseases. 

* By knowing all these, the physician should carefully examine each and every aspect in the 
light of the science.

The physician need not feel inferiority complex even though he doesn't know the 
nomenclature of the disease as there is no rule that every disease has a name. Hence one can 
treat the patient according to the dosas by applying samanya-visesa siddhanta.

Depending upon the nature of causative factors, dosas gets vitiated and travels all over the body 
and settles down at a weak point and causes various diseases in the body. Hence treatment 
should be given according to the nature of the disease.

One he, who should prescribe a drug after observing the following factors as well as the vitiated 
dosa never commits a mistake in treating a patient. 

1 . Dusya (dhatu & mala), 2. desa (habitat), 3. bala (strength of the patient), 4. kala (season), 5. 
anala (digestive power), 6. prakrti (body constitution), 7. vaya (age of the patient), 8. sattwa 
(strength of manaslmmd), 9. satmya (habituate yourself to) and 10. ahara (food and food 
habits).

The signs and symptoms of easygoing and dreadful diseases might appear in a different way 
due to the strength and weakness of the mind. That means a person, though suffering with a 
grievous disease and having strong will power can withhold pain and appears that he is 
suffering with a mild disease and vice versa. Hence a physician should carefully examine the 
patient in all aspects.

The physician, who is not having the proper idea of the disease condition will be mistaken the

grievous disease as mild one and unable to decide the appropriate dosage i.e. prescribe lower

Low potency drugs prescribed in a dreadful disease cannot cure the signs and symptoms and 
also causes the increase of vitiation of dosas. Similarly higher potency drugs prescribed in a 
mild disease causes harm at times to the life of the patient also. 

Physician's responsibility:

1 1 . Kapha aggravated, pitta more aggravated, vata most aggravated. 

1 2 . Kapha aggravated, vata more aggravated, pitta most aggravated . 

( d) Aggravation of all the 3 do s as in the same degree: 

1 3 . Vata, pitta and kapha aggravated in the same degree. 



212 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

Simultaneous aggravation of any two dosas (sarhsarga) is of 9 types as follows: 

(e) Aggravation of one do s as in excess: 

14. Pitta aggravated and vata more aggravated. 

1 5 . Pitta aggravated and kapha more aggravated. 

1 6. Vata aggravated and kapha more aggravated. 

1 7. Vata aggravated and pitta more aggravated. 

1 8 . Kapha aggravated and pitta more aggravated. 

1 9. Kapha aggravated and vata more aggravated. 

(f) Aggravation of two do s as in the same degree: 

20. Vata and pitta aggravated in the same degree. 

2 1 . Pitta and kapha aggravated in the same degree. 

22. Kapha and vata aggravated in the same degree. 

(g) Aggravation of only one do s a is of 3 types: 

23 . Vata aggravated. 

24. Pitta aggravated. 

25. Kapha aggravated. 

The diminution of dosas like aggravation is also of 25 types. So the total combination of 
aggravation and diminution are of 50 types. 

The twelve other alternate conditions of dosas depend on the aggravation and diminution taken 
together. 

(h) When one do s a is aggravated, the second do s a is in normal condition and the third do s a is in the 
state of diminution: 

5 1 . Vata aggravated, pitta in normal condition and kapha in the state of diminution. 

52. Pitta aggravated, kapha in normal condition and vata in the state of diminution. 

53. Kapha aggravated, pitta in normal condition and vata in the state of diminution. 

54. Vata aggravated, kapha in normal state and pitta diminished. 

55. Pitta aggravated, vatain normal condition and kaphain the state of diminution. 

56. Kapha aggravated, vata in normal condition and pitta in the state of diminution. 

(i) When the two do s as are aggravated and one do s a is in the state of diminution: 

57. Vata and pitta aggravated, kapha in the state of diminution. 

58. Pitta and kapha aggravated, vata in the state of diminution. 

59. Kapha and vata aggravated, and pitta in the state of diminution. 

( j) When one do s a is aggravated and the other two are in the state of diminution: 

60. Vata aggravated, pitta and kapha in the state of diminution. 

6 1 . Pitta aggravated, vata and kapha in the state of diminution. 

62. Kapha aggravated, vata and pitta in the state of diminution. 



Dosabhediya Adhyaya : 12 



213 



t\) Equilibrium state of all the trido s as: 

63 . Vata, pitta and kapha are in the normal state. 

Thus the number of combination of vitiated dosas is 62 and the 63 rd one is equilibrium state of 
all the three dosas. 



If the above mentioned 63 divisions of dosas and their sub-divisions like vrddhi, ksaya and 
tamata and also tara, tama bheda of these dosas are associated with rasa, rakta and other dusyas 
will attain innumerable divisions. Hence the physician should think upon such aspects by

* If vata and pitta combined together follow the regimen of grisma rtu. 



216 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

* Kapha and vata combined together follow the regimen of vasanta rtu, as the vata is 
possessing yogavahi guna. 

* In case of kapha and pitta combination the regimen is that of saradrtu. 

Procedure of treating dosas according to their stages: 

* It is easy to treat that when dosas are in the state of cay a. 

* If the dosas reached the prakopa stage, the treatment for the increased dosa should not 
interfere with the other dosas. 

* All the dosas are vitiated simultaneously treat the particular dosa at first whichever is more 
powerful without interfering with the others. 

* If all are of equal strength treatment should be given for vata at first, then pitta and at last 
kapha because that is the order of the strength. 

Ideal treatment: 

* An ideal treatment is that which doesn't produce any complications after treating the 
vitiated dosas. 

* It is not ideal, though it cures one disease and causes the increase of another dosa at the 
same time. 

Factors responsible for roaming dosas from kostha to sakha and sakha to kostha:

Due to exercises (excessive), acuteness of power of digestion, unwholesome regimen and the 
pressure of vata, dosas gets aggravated and spread from the central part of the body to the 
periphery. 

Due to the further aggravation, increase in fluidity, suppuration, removal of obstruction of the 
channels and reduced pressure of vata, the vitiated dosas leave the periphery and reach the 
central part of the body. 

There the dosas are waiting for the opportunity ; if conditions (like place, time and strength ) are 
favorable again the dosas gets vitiated and cause many diseases. 

Line of treatment for sthanika (local) and sthanagata (non local) dosas: 

* Vata is vitiated sometimes in the local area and other times in the area of kapha. 

* If the dosas gets vitiated in their local areas, the line of treatment is general i.e. by giving 
antidotes to that dosa. 



Dosopakramaniya Adhyaya : 13 217 

ta gets aggravated in the place of kapha and the treatment will be given keeping in view 
of the strength of the dosas. 

the strength of the non-local dosa is more, treat it immediately. If the local dosa gets 
much vitiated, treat the local dosa at first. If both of them are having same strength then also 
treat the local dosa at first and treat the other, later.

* Usually, tiryaggata dosascmse much difficulty to the patient for a long time. 

* Hence they should be examined carefully and treat them by observing the body strength 
and power of digestion.

them to kostha by easy methods and should be eliminated through the nearest route by 
suitable sodhana procedures.

The first tissue of the body rasa dhatu, which was not formed properly due to the weakness of 
the digestive fire and accumulating in the stomach in the abnormal state, is known as ama. 
3^ c^«TlJc||fti ^^i^i^^T^HIr^lcbl^^r^NHlci c^^LJIMHI *|WJc|l{jl2 6 II 

Some acaryas opine that ama gets formed from intimate mixing of vitiated dosas with one 
another just as the poison is formed from mixing of different kinds of kodrava (Paspalum 
scrobiculatum).

When the dosas and dusyas mixed with the ama, they can be called as sama dosa (or) sanm 
dusaya, which causes for the production of diseases. 

Sama dosa cikitsa:

* If the dosas are mixed with ama, and are circulating all over the body and may be 
accumulated in the tissues and also in the state of not stirring up, they should not be 
eliminated forcefully in those conditions. 

* Such an attempt will be taking the juice from an unripe fruit, which cause harm to the body. 

Procedure to eliminate dosas: 

MM$<5M: ^WIH^^MR4>dlHJI2 9ll 

Vitiated dosas should be expelled from the body in the state of nirama only, after administering 
the carminative and digestive drugs. Then oleation, sudation and followed by purificatory 
measures in accordance with the location and strength of the dosas.

* Drugs administered through mouth will be useful for the elimination of dosas from 
amasaya by means of emesis. 

* Those administered through the nostrils will be useful for the elimination of vitiated dosas 
from the head and above the shoulder region. 

* Drugs administered through rectum will be useful for the elimination of vitiated dosas from 
the large intestines by means of vasti.

Voluntary expulsion of vitiated sama dosas from the body through either any one of the routes

a number of diseases.

Such dosas expelling out should be ignored initially. Afterwards administer carminative and 
digestive drugs and convert sama dosas into nirama dosa and then eliminate them by means of 
-uitable purificatory measures.

Thus ends the thirteenth chapter entitled Dosopakramaniya Adhyaya of 
Sutra Sthana in Astariga Hrdaya Sarhhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Sirhhagupta. 

In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata explained the general line of treatment for tridosas, 
individually and also given the suggestion to manage the sarhsargaja and sannipataja dosas. 

ya Vagbhata expressed that these dosas gets vitiated not only due to the irregular diet, 
dietics etc. but also due to the variations of the seasons also. Hence the relationship between the 

s and seasons has been mentioned. Next, definition of ama, features of sarna and nirama 
dosas and also the line of treatment for ama dosas are explained. Vitiated dosas and their 
movement in the body, line of treatment, suitable time for sodhana therapy and time of 
I J ministration of medicine etc. have been discussed.

[Two Kinds of Therapies]

After 4 Dosopakramamya Adhyaya 9 Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Dvividho- 
pakramaniya ' (Two Kinds of Therapies), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

In the present chapter Acarya Vagbhata deals with the two types of treatment viz. nourishing 
therapy and reduction therapy, their advantages, complications and the treatment also have 
been discussed. 

Two kinds of treatment:

q^uil ci^H^rfrTrir^^f^ig^i^ril 1 ^££tc<M HfJH HIMc||i| i|^M2 II 

Two kinds of treatment have been mentioned namely santarpana (nourishing therapy) and 
apatarpana (reduction therapy); brmhana and langhana are the synonmys for the above 
therapeutic procedures respectively. 

B rrhha na: Whatever adds to the corpulence of the body is brmhana or nourishing therapy. 

Langhana: Whatever is capable to reduce the body is known as langhana or reducing therapy. 

Dominancy of mahabhuta: 

-*ra?T: Wit *AmMftd<vcl^ I 

Generally the body gets nourished by the use of substances having the dominancy of prthivi 
and ap mahabhutas, while it is reducing due to the substances having the agni, vayu and akasa 
mahabhutas. 

*jflMi n<;rM%U|l<f^d4 Hllrfcirfrl I 

Similarly snehana, ruksana, svedana and stambhana therapies are also showing their effects 
due to the dominancy of the basic elements only. 

Even though 6 types of treatments have been mentioned, all the six types can be incorporated in 
the above-mentioned two kinds of treatments i.e. brmhana and lahghanaonXy .

:herapy), 4. svedana (sudation therapy), 5. stambhana (astringent therapy) and 6. ruksana 
< drying therapy). 

Snehana and stambhana can be included in brmhana therapy while svedana and ruksana comes

Samana is that, which neither expels nor excites the dosas but mitigated the increased dosas 
and maintains the normalcy of the dosas within the body. It is of 7 types. 

] . Pacana (increased digestion), 2. dipana (carmination), 3. ksut (suppressing appetite), 4. trsna 
(suppressing thirst), 5. vyayama (exercises), 7. atapa (exposing to the sun) and 6. maruta

Notes : 

Obesity and its causes: 

Due to the excessive ingestion of heavy foods leads to indigestion and which in turn causes for 
the production of ama. 

Ama gets mixed with kapha at the tissue level and make them weak and causes increase of fatty 
tissue. 

Simultaneously the channels will be blocked, and the vata moving into gastro-intestinal tract, 
causes increase of digestive power, which results in excessive hunger, which in turn leads 
excessive intake of food and results in obesity. 

Signs and symptoms of obesity: 

* Excessive thirst, hunger and sweating. 

* Dyspnoea on exertion. 

* Excessive sleep. 

* Unable to do minimum physical exercises.

Food substances, which are having guruguna along with non-nutritious ones, are ideal for the

Useful in lumps in the abdomen, antitoxic, indicated in anorexia, disorders of kapha and heart 
and also in dysurea. 

In this way 33 groups of drugs have been enumerated for the management of various disease 
conditions. If all the drugs mentioned in any one of the groups are not available due to the 
season and ecological conditions, one can opt alternative drugs having similar therapeutic 
properties.

Thus ends the fifteenth chapter entitled Sodhanadigana Sangraha Adhyaya 
of Sutra Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Sarhhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta. 

In the present chapter initially the classification of the drugs according to the mode of their 
action such as sodhana and samana was enumerated. Then it was classified according to the 
action of several drugs which acts on a group of disease conditions and the nomenclature of the 



Sodhanadigana Sangraha Adhyaya : 15 253 

group was given by the drug mentioned at first such as vidaryadi gana, saribadi gana, 
padmakadi gana, guducyadi gana etc. 

For eg: guducyadi gana means the group is headed by guduci. By hearing the word guducyadi 
gana, one must be in a poition to recollect the group of drugs such as guduci, padmaka, arista, 
dhanyaka and rakta candana along with their actions viz pitta-kapha-hara, jwarahara, chardi, 
trsna & dahahara as well as increasing the power of digestion. 

Hence it is much more beneficial for the practitioner while treating a patient. 

In this way 33 groups of drugs have been enumerated by Vagbhata in this chapter.

Sneha-vidhi 
Adhyaya 

[01 eat ion Therapy] 



After ' Sodhanadigana Sangraha Adhyaya \ Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Sneha- 
vidhi 9 (Oleation Therapy), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

The main intention of Ayurveda is to maintain the positive health in the healthy individuals as 
well as to treat the diseased persons. To treat the diseased persons 3 kinds of therapeutic 
procedures have been mentioned such as daivavyapasraya, yuktivyapasraya and sattvavajaya 
( spiritual therapy , rational therapy and psychotherapy) . Further rational therapy is subdivided 
into 3 types viz. antahparimarjana, bahih-parimarjana and sastra-pranidhana (internal 
purification, external cleansing and surgical therapy). Both the internal purification and 
external cleansing can be incorporated into sadupakramas. For the sake of convenience in the 
treatment all the six therapeutic procedures can be grouped into two only such as brmhana and 
langhana (nourishing therapy and reducing therapy), which were already discussed in the 
previous chapter. Reducing therapy is again of 2 types: 

(a) Sodhana (elimination therapy) and (b) Samana (palliative therapy). 

Sodhana therapy: 

Sodhana therapy means purificatory measures. 
Maharsi Caraka has been classified them as under: 

1. Vamana karma (emesis) 

2. Virecana karma (purgation) 

3. Asthapana vasti (medicated enemata with decoctions) 

4. Anuvasana vasti (enemata with oils) 

5. Nasya karma (nasal administration) 

Where as in Susruta Samhita, rakta-moksana is added to the above by clubbing both types of 
vasti treatments as one, so that the number five remains the same. 

Before proceeding to the purificatory measures, pre-operative procedures like oleation and 
sudation should be conducted to bring back the vitiated dosas from sakhas (periphery) to 
kostha (central part of the body). Without conducting these preoperative techniques, the 
vitiated dosas cannot reach the central part of the body. 

Hence it is very much essential to conduct the pre-operative procedures prior to perform 
Pancakarma treatments. 





Sneha-Vidhi Adhyaya : 16 



255 



Before starting the therapy, physician should procure the drugs in required quantity, which will 
be useful for oleation therapy and also the antidotes, to manage the complications. 

Qualities of oleating drugs: 

^yHd^lW^H^^^^g^Hj *A$A W^t, fcWdd (c|^U|^H1 II 

Generally, drugs which are guru (heavy), sita (cold), sara (mobile), snigdha (unctuous), manda 
( slow), suksma (subtle), mrdu (soft) and drava (liquid) are useful for oleation therapy and the 
drugs having exactly opposite qualities like laghu (light), usna (hot), sthira (stable), ruksa 
( dry), tiksna (sharp), sthula (bulky), kathina (hard) and sandra (solid) are useful for dryness of 
the body. 

Literally sneha means oleate or to make smooth. The process of producing unctuousness, 
fluidity, softness and smoothness in the body is known as oleation.

Taila 



Though there are a number of unctuous substances available in the nature sarpih (ghee), majja 
(bone marrow), vasa (muscle fat) and taila (sesame oil) are the best among them. 

Out of all unctuous substances, ghee is the best one, because it follows the properties of the 
substances with which it is processed, as it is sweet in taste, not producing any burning 
sensation and is taken since birth. 

Sarpih, majja, vasa and taila are superior to one another in mitigating pitta in the preceding 
order, and in their succeeding order they mitigate vata and kapha. 

Ghrta, taila, vasa and majja are heavier to one another in their succeeding order that means 
bone marrow is the heaviest among the four unctuous substances. 

ST^f^3^^4^cbf^<^ HSHJI4II 

The combination of any of the two unctuous substances can be known as yamaka. If any of 



256 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

three substances combined together it is called trivrt and the combination of all the four 
oleating substances are known as mahan. 

These oleating substances will get from two different sources known as animals and plants — 
(a) Animal source — curds, milk, muscle, bone. From which ghee, muscle fat and bone marrow 
can be collected, (b) Plant source — fruits and stem yield oils.

Astahga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 



Mode of administration of oleating substances: 




Oleating substances should be administered internally after considering the dosage, season, 
vitiated dosa and the body constitution as follows: 

Vicarana (mixed with food substances), vasti (medicated enemata), nasya (nasal 
administration), abhyanga (body massage), gandusa (mouth gargles), murdha taila (siro- 
abhyanga, seka, picu and sirovasti), karnapurana (ear drops) and aksitarpana (satiating 
therapies to the eye). 

Sneha vicarana: 

^^^ehchr^lW ^ Nfe^ l lU I I : IM 5 II 
^WI^lf^JfTrr* 




* Administering the oleating substances internally by mixing them with other food 
substances is known as vicarana. Internal administration of oleating substances without 
adding any other substance is known as accha peya. 

* Sneha vicaranas are of 64 types in accordance with that number of combinations of rasas. 

* Accha peya gives proper oleating signs and symptoms faster than vicaranlya . Hence the 
former is superior to the later. 

Dosage of oleating substances: 



The quantity of oil digested in two yamas (six hours) is called hrasva matra. Madhayama 
matra will be digested in four yamas (twelve hours) and the quantity, which, will be 
digested in eight yamas (24 hours), is called uttama matra. 

Keeping the intensity of dosas, seasons, wholesomeness etc in mind, start the oleation 
therapy, with the minimum dose or less than that is called hrasiyasi matra or test dose. 
Oil should not be administered internally without knowing the kostha. If so, at times the 
life of the patient may be put into danger. 



Hrasva matra: 

* It is indicated for the persons who are weak, having decreased digestive power, children, 
aged, delicate persons, habituated to take unwholesome food, remains empty, suffering 
with fever, diarrhoea, cough etc. 

* It is ideal because it is easy to administer, as the quantity is less. 

* It gives strength slowly. 

* And is not creating any complications.

having mrdu kostha. 

* It will produce unctuousness in the body, without reducing the strength of the body. 

* Though complications may arise, they are mild. 

* It also helps to eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body.

1. Sodhana sneha: 

Oleating substances used for the sake of elimination, maximum dose is to be given early in the 
morning without mixing with any other substances and after the completion of the digestion of 
the food taken in the previous night. Here the drug is administering in maximum dose and for a 
shorter duration i.e. maximum 7 days. 

2. Samana sneha: 

Administration of the oleating substances internally in the medium dose, in the empty stomach 
when the person gets hungry, is known as samana sneha. 

Here the dosage of the unctuous substances are less than sodhana sneha and should be 
administered till the symptoms of the diseases disappeared. 

3. Brmhana sneha: 

Administration of unctuous substances in a minimum dosage, which is mixed with mutton 
soup, wine and along with the food for a longer period for the nourishment of the body is known 
as brmhana sneha.

management of the diseases occurring to the lower, middle and upper parts of the body 
respectively and also gives strength to the body parts in the similar order. 

Anupana for different unctuous substances: 

* Generally hot water is to be given immediately after administering the unctuous 
substances, for the easy digestion and to remove the coating in the mouth. 

* But hot water should not be given while administering the substances having hot in 
potency such as tuvaraka taila and aruskara taila.

purpose of eliminating the vitiated dosas. 

Notes : 

Snehapana vidhi : Purva karma (Pre-operative procedure): 

* Before starting the oleation therapy, screen the patient whether the patient is eligible or not.

medicines (carminatives) to stimulate the digestive power and to make the G. L tract light. 

* Assess the kostha and have a plan regarding the duration of the therapy as 3 days, 5 days 
and 7 days in mrdu, madhyama and krura kostha respectively. 

Kost ha parlk sa: 

Intake of jaggary, sugarcane juice, milk, whey, rice pudding, ghee, grape juice, hot water etc. 
serves as a purgative for those having mrdu kostha. The above cannot produce purgative effect 
in krura kostha, where as in madhyama kostha mild laxative effect can be seen.

While administering medicated oils in the disease conditions like kustha, sopha and prameha 
those oleating substances should not be mixed with guda, anupa marhsa, ksira, tila, masa, sura 
and dadhi. 

Hence it is ideal that the oleating substances should be processed with thphala, pippali, pathya, 
guggulu etc. while using them in kustha and other diseases as they are harmless and doesn't 
produce any side-effects.

Vamana and virecana: 

Expulsion of vitiated dosas through mouth can be termed as emesis, and through rectum can be 
c ailed as purgation. In both the conditions as the vitiated dosas are expelling from the body, the 
term 'virecana 'is suitable for both emesis and pur-gation. 

Mode of action of the emetics and purgatives: 



An the emetic drug contain usna, tiksna, suksma, vyavayi and vikasigunas and also due to their 
potency they will reach the region of the heart through the minute channels. Due to oleation and 
sudation the vitiated dosas become liquefied and enter into minute channels. There the emetic 
drug further liquefies the dosas due to usna guna and breaks into pieces because of tiksna and 
igunas. From there the liquefied dosas reach the kostha without sticking to the channels 
e water runs through the walls of the earthenware which has been anointed with oil. Then 
the vitiated dosas will be expelled through mouth, because of the drugs having the dominancy 
of agni and vayu bhutas, involvement of udana vata and also the upward movement of the 
emetic drug. And the vitiated dosas will be expelled through rectum, because of the drugs 
having the dominancy of prthivi and ap mahabhutas, involvement of apana vata and also the 
downward movement of the purgative drug. 

If the drugs have both these qualities, they will be having emetic as well as purgative action. 




278 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

Emesis and purgation according to dosas: 

Emesis is to be conducted when: 

• Kapha is vitiated alone or in association of pitta. 

• Pitta and vata occupies the place of kapha. 

• Increase of tridosas, with the predominance of kapha. 

Purgation is to be conducted when: 

• Pitta is vitiated alone or in association of kapha. 

• Kapha occupies the place of pitta etc.

animals of marshy land, and aquatic animals, fish, milk, curd, black gram, sesame, 
vegetables and liquid foods. 

* After the completion of the digestion of the food taken on the previous day the patient is 
asked to have head bath, besmeared with sandalwood paste and others, wear white clothes 
and flower garlands and then perform spiritual rites. 

* Apply oil on the head and chest and do gentle massage and sudation. 

* Afterwards ask the patient to drink milk, buttermilk, mutton soup, sugarcane juice, thin

Brahma, Daksa Prajapati, Aswani kumaras, Rudra, Indra, Bhumi, Candra, Surya, Agni, all 
the Sages along with Medicinal Herbs, Panca Mahabhutas protect you.' 

Let the medicine be to you similar to rasayana for the Sages, amrta for Gods and sudha for 
the Serpents. 'Om, salutation to the worshipful Bhaisajyaguru, the Vaidurya Prabharaja, 
the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Samyak Sambuddha, Om, bhaisajye, bhaisajye, maha 
bhaisajye, samudgate . By uttering these hymns, one has to take the emetic drug. Suggest 
the patient to concentrate his mind in the process of emesis only.

* After consuming emetic drug one should wait for a muhurta kala (48 minutes) for the 
commencement of vomiting with keen intent. After the appearance of oppression in the 
chest and salivation one should try to vomit. 

* Forceful expulsion should not be done. To encourage the urge, tickling the throat, with 
either of his fingers or with the stalks of lotus, lily or castor. 

* Onset of perspiration indicates the liquefaction of dosas. Horripilations indicate the dosas 
are dislodging from their places of stagnation. 

Abdominal distension suggests dosas reached the stomach. Nausea and salivation 
indicates the upward movement of the dosas. 

* Then instruct the patient to vomit without bending his head too much and his head should 
be supported while vomiting. 

* The attendant should give gentle massage in the upward direction over the umbilical region 
and back.

In case of only kapha disorders emesis should be conducted with tlksna, usna guna and katu 
rasa drugs and when kapha is associated with pitta it should be conducted with madhura rasa 
and sita virya drugs, where as kapha associated with vata, emesis should be conducted with 
snigdha guna, amla and la vana rasa drugs.

Afterwards either in the same day evening or next day morning after feeling hungry, the patient 
is advised to take hot water bath and give light food such as peya and other items prepared with 
red variety of sali rice, described in sarhsarjanakrama. 

S aihsarjanakrama: 

After sodhana therapy body becomes weak, systems become delicate and the digestive power

also gets diminished. The process of restoration of digestive power by means of advocating 
specific regimen of diet is known as samsarjana krama. 

Peya, vilepi etc. are diet regimen: 

According to the administration of the type of drug sodhana is of 3 types viz: pravara suddhi. 
madhyama suddhi and avara suddhi. 

Peya (thin gruel), vilepi (thick gruel), akrta or krtayusa (soup) and marhsa rasa (mutton soup) 
can be given to the persons who had pravara suddhi for 3-3 anna kalas. For the persons who had 
madhyama suddhi for 2-2 anna kalas while it should be given for 1 - 1 anna kala in a vara suddhi. 
Therefore the normal diet can be given on the 14th anna kala or 7th day evening in pravara 
suddhi and 1 Oth anna kala or 5 th day evening in madhyama suddhi and 6th anna kala or 3rd day 
evening in avara suddhi.

Virecana-vidhi (Purgation therapy): 

Purva karma (Preoperative procedure): 

* In general purgation should not be conducted without emesis except in costive bowel. 
Purgation therapy should be conducted only to the persons who have undergone oleation 
and sudation, again after emesis. 

* The day before purgation, the patient should be given mutton soup and the diet, which 
should not stir up kapha. It should be warm, liquid, and unctuous added with sour fruit 
juices such as pomegranate etc. 

* On the day of purgation, after the completion of the process of digestion of the food taken in 
the previous day, purgative drug is to be administered early in the morning, after passing 
the period of predominance of kapha dosa, after determining the nature of kostha. 

* Purgative drug should be administered in the empty stomach only. 

* Whenever pitta is predominant, the nature of kostha will be known as mrdu kostha (soft 
bowels) and even milk causes purgation. 

* Similarly the nature of kostha will be assessed as krura kostha (hard or costive bowels) 
when there is dominancy of vata and causes purgation with great difficulty even after the 
administration of syama, snuhi, kankustha and other drastic purgatives. 

Pradhana karma: 

* Purgation without emesis causes the obstruction of the purgative drug by vitiated kapha 
and the drug may act adversely and also loose its power of elimination. Due to the forceful 
action of the purgative drug, accumulated kapha reaches the left side of the abdomen, 
duodenum and causes distention of abdomen or dysentery. 

* These complications will not occur in the persons having costive bowel, because of the 
predominance of vata. 

* The complications observed in purgation without emesis are also found in case of 
conducting purgation during the period of kapha predominance. Pain, distension of the 
abdomen and heaviness are the symptoms observed. 

* Hence purgative drug should be given only after passing the period of kapha dominancy. 

Suitable purgative drug according to dosa: 

* Purgation is to be conducted with the drugs, which are having kasaya and madhura rasa for 
pitta diseases. Where as katu rasa drugs should be given in kapha disorders and snigdha, 
usna and lavana rasa (unctuous, hot and salty) substances are indicated for vata disorders. 



Vamana Virecana-Vidhi Adhyaya : 18 



287 



>on after the purgative drug has been given, cold water should be sprinkled on the face of 
the patient to prevent the occurrence of vomiting. 

Then asked the patient to gargle his mouth with warm water and inhale the smell of soil, 
lemon, madiphala, jasmine etc. 

* Afterwards the patient is asked to take rest in a room, which is devoid of heavy breeze, and 
drink warm water at regular intervals to initiate the urges. 

iiould not suppress the urges and evacuate the bowels in the bed pan to measure the 
quantity of output. 

x During the process of purgation, vata, urine, faeces, pitta, and kapha will be expelled in the 
8 ucceeding order and flatus, at the end. 

Measures to be followed in the absence of bouts: 

If the bouts are not started, the patient is asked to drink hot water to activate the drug and his 
ibdomen should be fomented with hands made warm. 

Replication of purgative drug administration: 

* If the given drug doesn't serve the purpose of eliminating the vitiated dosa, he is allowed to 
take food on that day and sufficient dose of the purgative drug can be administered on the 
next day. 

* If the purgative drug is being digested without doing its function, second dose can be given 
on the same day. 

* Never administer second dose without knowing the position of the drug, which may cause 
severe complications. If the purgation therapy may not be fulfilled successfully due to the 
improper oleation and sudation, give rest for a period of 10 days and conduct the total 
procedure systematically without repeating the previous mistakes.

After obtaining proper signs and symptoms of purgation follow the post-operative regimen 
similar to emesis except dhumapana. Afterwards follow samsarjana krama. 

After the administration of virecana drug, the person is advised to go for lahghana (fasting) in 
the following 5 conditions: 

1 . Manda vahni (loss of power of digestion). 

2. Asarhsuddha (improper signs of purification). 

3. Aksama (not became emaciated due to so dhana therapy). 

4. Dosa durbala (not become weak by the increase of dosa). 

5. Adrsta jirna Hnga (not appearing the symptoms of the digestion of the administered 
purgative drug). 



Yamana Virecana-Vidhi Adhyaya : 18 289 

Conduction of fasting in the above conditions doesn't cause any sort of discomfort due the 
obstruction of dosas, which were aggravated by oleation and sudation. 

Necessity of peyadi krama: 

fivNHI^f^WN^^^lvjIHd^: 1145 M 

Soon after the elimination therapy, bloodletting, oleation etc. the digestive power gets 
aired. Hence 'peyadi samsarjana krama 'is to be followed. 

Ineligible for peyadi krama: 

^dlc*MftM*^bMlui H£Jlj cHdOPr|cbHJI46M 

Peyadi samsarjana krama 'should not be given in the following conditions: 

Oozing of little quantity of pitta and kapha, habituated alcoholic, vata-pitta constitution, 
For those tarpana is indicated. 

Commencement of drug action: 

Emetic drug will act without undergoing the process of digestion, where as purgative drug acts 
only after undergoing the process of digestion. Hence the physician need not wait for digesting 
the emetic drug. 

<^N£T^MMI^H ^:^Tq;U48ll 

Person, who is weak and in a condition of increased vitiation of dosas develop bouts of 
purgation even without administering the purgative drug, In such circumstance he should be 
treated with the foods having the property of bhedana (purgative). 

Reasons for administration of mild drugs to the weak persons etc: 
^fcT:?Ttftj?T: ^cfMcM^N: ^ft^: 1149 II 

* Administer the drug having mild potency as well as less in quantity in the following 
conditions: 

Durbala (weak persons), sodhita purvam (undergone purificatory measures previously), 
alpadosa (mild vitiation of dosa), krsa (emaciated), aparijnata kostha (unknown bowels), 

* It is better to administer lesser doses in frequent intervals. Otherwise it may be harmful and 
cause even death. 



290 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

* The drug in smaller and repeated doses will be able to eliminate the vitiated dosas from the 
body gradually and brings back the normalcy of dosas without causing any weakness in the 
body. 

* Dosas should be eliminated from the body of a weak person, when they are in the state of 
mild vitiation only. Other-wise they trouble the person greatly and even kill him. 

Procedure of elimination in case of mandagni and krura kostha:

Those who are having weak digestive power and costive bowels (krura kostha) should be given 
ghee processed with alkalies and salts prior to the administration of purificatory drugs to 
restore the power of digestion as well as to conquer kapha and vata. 

Administer vasti before purgation in case of ruksa and others:

* Purgative drug is being digested and eliminated from the body without performing it's 
action in the following conditions: 

Ruksa (who are dry), bahu anila (excessive vitiation of vata), krura kostha (costive 
bowels), vyayamasili (doing regular exercises), diptagni (strong digestive power). 

* In such circumstances conduct vasti karma initially followed by snigdha virecana with 
eranda tailaox bindughrta. 

(or) 

* Remove the obstructed faeces by means of phalavarti (rectal suppositories) and then 
administer snigdha virecana dravya.

disorders), sopha (swelling), visarpa (herpes), kamala (jaundice), pandu (anemia), meha 
(diabetes) etc. should be administered purgative drug after mild oleation. 

All the above should be given snigdha virecana and those who are unctuous should be given 
ruksa virecana. 

Conduct oleation and sudation in between purificatory measures:

h between emesis and other purificatory therapies oleation and sudation should be conducted 
jod at the end of purification again oleation is advised to gain strength. 

Importance of sneha and sweda — a simile: 



Just like the dirt from a cloth is being removed after properly washed, vitiated dosas also 
mill be eliminated from the body by means of purificatory measures preceded by oleation 
and sudation. 

\d\antages of sneha & sweda:

Similar to a dry stick, which is being tried to bend without applying oil and heat, the body is 
- * crumbled when administered purificatory measures without undergoing oleation and 
sudation. 

Benefits of purificatory therapies: 

Properly administered purificatory drug will give— lucidity of the mind, strengthens the sense 
organs, gives stability to the tissues, improves digestive power, reduces ageing etc. 



In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata explained the eliminatory procedures such as emesis and 
purgation in a systematic way. Definition of emesis and purgation, mode of action, indications 
ose techniques according to dosas, eligible and not eligible persons for emesis and 
purgation, pre-operative, operative and post-operative procedures of emesis and purgation, 
wmsarjana krama&z. have been discussed. In the end the importance of proper administration 
of the purificatory drugs was mentioned. 





Thus ends the eighteenth chapter entitled Vamana-virecana-vidhi Adhyaya 
of Sutra Sthana in Astariga Hrdaya Sarhhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Siiiihagupta.

ASTI-VIDHI 




After ' Vamana-Virecana-vidhi', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Basti-vidhi' 
(Medicated Enemata), thus said Atreya and other great sages. 

Definition of basti/vasti: 

The term vasti or basti is given due to the administration of medicated drugs into the rectum by 
means of urinary bladder of various animals like cow, deer, goat, sheep etc. or due to the stay of 
administered drug near by urinary bladder for some time. 

Importance and types of basti: 

Basti is the best line of treatment for vata as well as vata predominant disorders. It causes 
instant relief, nourishment to the body and also eliminates the vitiated vata dosas completely 
from the body. 

Basti is of 3 types viz. 

1 . Asthapana basti 

2. Anuvasana basti 

3. Uttara basti. 

Notes: 

Asthapana basti:

and mineral origin, according to the involvement of demand dusyas. 

The different types of asthapana basti s are: 

1. Utkledana vasti (exciting), 2. sodhana vasti (purificatory), 3. saniana vasti (mitigating), 4. 
lekhana vasti (scarifying), 5. brmhana vasti (nourishing), 6. vajikaraiia vasti (aphrodisiac), 
7. piccha vasti (which arrests the expulsion of liquids from the body), 8. madhu tailika vasti 
(honey and oil are the main ingredients), 9. yapana vasfr (can be given for long periods), 10. 
yuktaratha vasti (can travel after vasti), 1 1 . siddha vasti (can obtain the expected results), 



Basti-Vidhi Adhyaya : 19 



293 



tjnrnrfnn (alleviate dosas) are the synonyms for madhu-tailika vasti.

dravyai.c. 3 prasrtaor 300 ml. 

Notes: 

Anuvasana vasti: 

Anuvasana vasti is the medicated enemata in which the four types of unctuous substances 
mentioned in oleation therapy, is used after processing with the appropriate drugs and is 
intended for producing lubrication. 



Basti- Vidhi Adhyaya : 19

Anuvasana vastiis of 3 types according to the dosage: 

(a) Sneha vasti (b) Anuvasana vasti (c) Matra vasti 

* 1/4 quantity of niruha vastiis sneha vasti i.e. 300 ml.; half of the quantity of sneha vasti is 

uvasana vastii.z. 150 ml only. Half the quantity of anuvasana vasti is matra vasti i.e. 75 
ml only. 

fatra vasti is one of the types of anuvasana vasti and its dose is equivalent to that of 
minimum dose of oleation therapy. It is also be given regularly as that of madhutailika vasti 
to the persons who are old, children, walking long distances, carrying heavy loads, 
traveling by vehicles, doing regular exercises, undergoing excessive coitus etc. 

* As it can be conducted regularly or daily it is called anuvasana vasti.

The person who is to be treated with asthapana should have undergone oleation, sudation, 
emesis and purgation therapies earlier and gained strength by following the regimen of specific 
fief mentioned in sarhsarjana krama. He should be eligible 
for anuvasana vasti also. Hence anuvasana vasti is to be 
given prior to asthapana vasti. 

Anuvasana vasti should be given during day time in winter 
and spring seasons; and during night time in other seasons, 
tberwise complications may arise which were mentioned in 
oleation therapy. 

* Prior to start the therapy, procure vastinetra and 
\ ustiputaka, which are not having any defects. 

1 Then prepare the vasti dra vya in a required quantity according to age group. 

* Afterwards gentle massage on the body is to be conducted with suitable oil followed by 
mild fomentation. 

* Then ask the patient to have light food, which is neither too unctuous nor too dry. 

* Never administer the unctuous enemata in the empty stomach. 

* Administered unctuous enemata in the empty stomach travels in the upward direction 
quickly due to its mobile, far reaching and minuteness. And which cannot be useful to 
control vata, simultaneously causing complications. 

* If administered after taking food, it obstructs the flow of the given substance in the upward 
direction and will stay in the large intestines, so that the expected results will get. 




298 Astanga Hrdayam : Sut ra-sthana 

* After having food ask the patient is to walk a distance of at least 1 00 yards. 

* Then ask the patient to defecate or micturate if necessary. 

* Afterwards the patient is asked to lie down on the table in the left lateral position.

down and be attentive to the movement of vasti dravya spreading inside the body. After 
getting the urge only pass the stools. 

* Conduct gentle massage with oil all over the body especially on the painful regions so that 
the administered oil doesn't come out soon. 

* If the given oil comes out quickly second dose may be given at the same time.

Three kinds of vasti according of their action: 

Some others opined that the following three types of vasti should be administered in the 
following order. 

• Utklesana vasti - to increase dosas 

• Sodhana vasti - to eliminate 

• Samana vasti - to mitigate the residual dosas. 

(^Nyifc^tfH: flcfiidr^yMIUI^r^ |

8th : Sneha vasti should be given. 

Either sneha vasti or niruha vasti should not be given continuously: 

Never administer either unctuous enemata or decoction enemata continuously. If the sneha 
vasti is given continuously the power of digestion will be decreased and the continuous 
administration of niruha vasti leads to the aggravation of vata. 

Hence sneha vasti and niruha vasti is to be given alternatively, so that the equilibrium state of 
the dosas will be maintained. 

Matra vasti:

Tying heavy loads, traveling by vehicles, doing regular exercises, undergoing excessive 
itus, vata roga, fractured, debilitated, having decreased digestive power, royal, wealthy,

Matra vasti brings the normalcy of dosas without causing any inconvenience. It gives strength, 
eliminates dosast&sWy, doesn't need strict regimen and is comfortable. 

Uttara vasti:

After having bath, patient is given food according to the regimen pescribed for sneha vasti 
and then the patient is asked to defecate or micturate if necessary. 
Then he should be made to sit on a stool of knee height. 

When penis is erected, introduce a probe in the urethral passage to find out the route. 
Afterwards anointed puspanetra is to be introduced into the urethral passage completely, 
which is connected to vastiputaka, and then sqeeze well, by taking with all precautions, 
such as without shaking the hands etc. 

After the expulsion of unctuous substance it can be repeated for 3 to 4 times on the same 
day. 

If the drug is not expelled even in the next day it should be withdrawn by means of phala 
varti. 

After the withdrawal of given drug, follow the postoperative regimen as that of sneha vasti. 
Management of the complications is also similar to that of sneha vasti.

The ideal time for the uttara vasti in females is during rtukala. 

* During that period uterus and os will be opened so that the drug administered can pass 
easily and mitigates vata, and there-by chances of getting conception rapidly. 

* In an emergency like prolapsed uterus, pain in the uterus or vagina and in bleeding 
disorders uttara vasti can be conducted without observing rtukala.

Importance of vasti:

* Vasti \s the best line of treatment for vata disorders. It causes instant relief, nourishment to 
the body and also eliminates the vitiated vata dosas completely from the body. 

* Vata is the leader among the dosika trio, independent, and is responsible for all the 
physiological functions of the body. 

* As it is of five types, it occupies all parts of the body, controls creation, sustenance and 
destruction of all external and internal things and also causes for the production of diseases 
in all the three pathways. 

* Though emesis and purgation eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body, the drugs used in 
those therapies are pungent, sharp and hot in potency, which cannot be taken easily by the 
children and old persons. But vasl/can be given in all age groups without any hesitation. 

* Hence it is also advisable for children, old persons, emaciated, obese, tissue depletion, 
weak sense organs, women, infertility or difficulty in labor due to the vitiation of vata. It is 
also advisable to improve digestive power, color complexion, intelligence, voice, life span 
and happiness. 

* Vasti is useful to maintain the youth and also beneficial in diseases like lameness, 
urustambha, fractures, contractures, distension of abdomen, colic, anorexia, reverse 
peristalsis, cutting pain in the rectum etc. 



Basti- Vidhi Adhyaya : 19

f$KU: ^fcMUWr^lr^l: T^TW^rft I 

Taila (sesamum oil) is the best drug of choice for nasal administration as the head is the seat for 
kapha dosa and the other oleating substances are not suitable for the elimination of vitiated 
kapha.

* Marsa nasya acts faster and having greater benefits and also causes complications where as 
pratimarsa nasya acts slowly and benefits are less and devoid of complications. Hence 
marsa is superior to pratimarsa. 

* Accha peya (drinking of unctuous substances alone) and vicaraniya in take of oil mixed 
with other substances, kutlpravesika (indoor regimen) and vatatapika (outdoor regimen), 
anuvasana (oleus enema) and matra vasti ( oil enema with very little oil) are also should be 
considered in the same way.

of oil and prepare the medicated oil as per the procedure. Then take the 2nd part and then 3rd. In 
this way it should be boiled for 1 0 times. 

At the final stage of boiling (i.e. the 10th) equal quantity of goat's milk should be added to it.

substances it relieves the redness of the eye, 
lachrymation, friction in the eyes, pain and burning 
sensation, pricking pain, ulceration, oedema, itching etc.

* Collyrium should not be applied at nights, during sleep, midday and when strong sunrays 
exhaust the eyes. 

* If it is applied during the contraindicated timings it will lead the increase of dosas and 
results in various eye disorders. 



342 Astariga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

* It should be done both in the morning and evening hours, when the sky is clear without any 
clouds. 

Notes: 

* When it is too hot or too cold, or it is cloudy and too breezy, anjana should not be applied. 

* It should be applied to the painful eye at first, and next to the rest. 

* If both the eyes are painful apply the collyrium with both the index fingers at a time. 

Some other scholars opine that strong collyrium shouldn't apply during midday, as they will 
make the eyes debilitated by excessive watery discharge and become further weakened due to 
the presence of sun. 

Suitable time for tiksnanjana: 

Usfi chlcHW ffll-M^H rTrlHJdl l^ldfllciAII <£'IH^4) feHdi H^^T: 111 9 II 

* Though the eyes are exhausted by strong collyrium, the eyes will regain its strength due to 
the following reasons — 

•By good sleep. 

• Due to cool nature of nighttime. 

• As the eyes are predominant with agni bhuta and being habituated to cold comforts. 

* Hence it is advised to apply strong collyrium during night hours. 

* During daytime also, strong collyrium can be applied in the following conditions: 

• Whenever kapha is predominantly vitiated. 

• Diseases like sukra-armaetc. which are suitable for lekhana (scarification). 

• Whenever the sun is not so hot. 

Simile regarding metals and eyes: 

3i?H*i) vx|~M cflgHI dd Mel *f rft$UTrTT UMmdhfa r^c| rTOT r^fl: 112 1 II 

Metals are born from stones and they will attain their sharpness (by rubbing on it) as well as 
bluntness with them only. 

Similarly eyes are tejatmaka and they will get benefits as well as disadvantages with the same 
tejasby the proper and improper utilization. 

Unsuitable conditions for tisnanjana: 

Strong collyrium shouldn' t be applied even in night hours when there is severe cold, as they are 
unable to eliminate the dosas and causes itching, sluggishness and stagnation of dosas.

Adhyaya 

[Application of Blunt Instruments] 



'Tarpana Putapaka-vidhi', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Yantra-vidhi' 
Application of Blunt Instruments), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

Definition of salya: 

The foreign body, which causes troubles to the mind as well as the body, is known as salya. 

Different kinds of instruments:

The different kinds of instruments, which will be useful to remove the foreign bodies, which 
are lodged in different parts of the body, are known as yantras (instruments with blunt edges). 

They will be useful to examine the piles, fistula-in-ano, application of sharp instruments, 
alkalies and thermal cauterization and to protect the other parts of the body. Those instruments 
are also useful to conduct guda vasti, uttara vasti, vrana vasti md other therapeutic procedures. 

Ghatika yantra (pot), alabu (gourd), srhga (horns) jambavoustha salaka (jambula probe) etc. 
are some of the blunt instruments. 



-3 

Blunt instruments having different shapes and functions will be useful in different conditions. 

Hence they are innumerable and it is not possible to mention all of them in detail and can be 
fabricated according to the need of the hour by applying his mind. 

Some other acaryas opined that the yantras are one hundred and one. Among those, surgeon's 
hand is rightly considered as the principal instrument, for without its help no instrument can 
properly be used.

The leaches put in a container may become poisonous by consuming saliva, urine and faeces of 
iheir own. Hence to protect them, they should be transferred in to another containers having 
fines h water and mud etc. for every 3 or 5 days. 

Management of bleeding: 

If there is any residual impure blood at the site of leach application, rub it with turmeric 
powder, honey and jaggary. 

Then wash the area with cold water and apply gauze piece or cotton soaked in satadhouta ghrta 
or pastes prepared from sita virya dra vyas such as yastimadhu, candana, usira etc.

* Alabu and ghati yantra should not be used for bloodletting whenever pitta is predominantly 
vitiated, as the process is involving with agni. 

* Hence alabu and ghati y antra are indicted for kapha and vata disorders.

Srnga should not be used to aspirate the blood vitiated by kapha because of the thickness of the 
blood. But it can be aspirated by means of srnga whenever vata and pitta vitiate the blood. 

Notes: 

The author of Astanga Sahgraha has given the details about the process of bloodletting by 
means of srnga, alabu and ghati yantra as follows (A.S. Su. 35): 

S rrigavacara na: 

* Application of horns of cow, buffalo etc. to aspirate vitiated blood from the body is known 
as srhgavacarana. 

* Horn is of 7 inches length, and the circumference is of a thumb size and black gram size at 
the base and tip respectively. 

* Before starting the procedure, give a small incision at the place from where the blood is to 
be aspirated and allow the blood to flow for some time. Then apply horn on the part after 
wrapping a clean cloth at the base. After that, aspirate the blood from the tip of the horn 
with mouth. 

Alabu : 

* Generally it is known as tumbi. 

* Take the medium sized fruit, cut the stalk region and then remove the pulp and use the shell 
for blood letting. 

* Lit a lamp or a cotton piece and put it inside the fruit. 

* Then give a small incision and apply this gourd by approximating the edges of the mouth so 
closely that no atmospheric air enters into it. 

* The lamp will be off after exhausting the oxygen inside the fruit and vacuum will be 
formed, which will be helpful to suck the blood from the body. 

* After 10-15 minutes remove the gourd and apply jatyadi ghrta and then bandage with 
sterile cloth. 

Gha t i yantra : 

The method of application is similar to alabu. 
Pracchana: 




377 



* A long cloth piece or a rope or a leather strap is to be tied above the part of the body, where it 
i s selected for venesection. 

Care should be taken while conducting venesection by avoiding the places such as tendons, 
joints and vital points. 
1 Incision should be given from downward to upword direction only. 
I ncision should not be too deep, too wide and horizontal (sidewards). 

Different types of blood-letting in different conditions: 



Pracchana is indicated to drain the accumulated blood from a particular point. 

* Deep-seated blood can be extracted with the help of leach application. 

To drain the vitiated blood, which has settled in different layers of the skin, srnga, alabu 
and ghatiy antra will be useful. 

* Venepuncture is advised whenever vitiated blood circulates in the body. 

Srnga, jalouka and alabu are especially indicated for vata, pitta and kapha disorders 
respectively. 

I implications and their management: 

. ter the completion of the process of blood letting, if the cold pastes are applied on the region, 
Mta will be gets aggravated and develops pricking pain, itching and swelling etc. Hence 
> uring warm ghee over the affected part is advised. 



In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata has been explained various types of surgical instruments in 
fetail. 26 sharp instruments and their functions, their description; accessory instruments like 
.Lia. alabu Jalouka tic. have been discussed. 




Thus ends the twenty-sixth chapter entitled Satra-vidhi Adhyaya of Sutra 
Sthana in Astaiiga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya 
Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Siriihagupta.

[Venesection] 




After ' Sastra-vidhi Adhyaya', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 1 Siravyadha-vidhi' 
(Venesection), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. 

(In the previous chapter blood letting with accessory instruments have been discussed such as 
leach, horn, gourd and pot etc. 

In the present chapter blood letting with the help of sharp instruments along with pre-operati ve 
and post-operative care has been discussed.) 

SIRAVYADHA (VENESECTION) 

Importance of venesection: 

There are a number of techniques for blood-letting, which were described earlier. Among 
them, and in the therapies like purgation, venesection occupies the most important place for the 
management of curable diseases. 

As the water comes out and the plants die on cutting the borders of the field, vitiated blood 
comes out and automatically the diseases will be cured on performing venesection. 

As far as Kayacikitsa is concerned vasti karma is an important therapeutic procedure, because 
almost all the curable diseases can be cured with the help of the same. Similarly siravedhana 
occupies a unique position in Salya-tantra as it can manage a number of diseases. 

Blood is the seat for the diseases, which were caused by the vitiation of the blood and hence 
venesection is the first line of treatment suggested. 

Features of pure blood: 

Hlftci THTcf: ^pg, dH^^cl x\ f^fci : I 

* Pure blood is sweet and slightly salt in taste, neither too cold nor hot and liquid. 

* Its color resembles as follows: 

Padma (lotus flower), indragopa (bright red insect), hema (inanjistha) (rubia cordifolia), 
avi, sasa lohita lohitam (resembling the blood of sheep and hare). 

* Such blood is known as pure blood and it keeps the body healthy. 

* The blood formed due to the in take of wholesome food cause, strength, color, complexion, 
happiness and longe-vity of the body.

Due to the intake of opposite qualities of the substances and also the nature of autumn season 
rtu), the blood gets vitiated by pitta and kapha and causes the following disorders. 

\lsarpa (herpes), vidradhi (abscess), pliha (enlargement of spleen), gulma (tumor), 
isadana (decreased power of digestion), jwara (fever), mukha, netra, siroroga (diseases of 
loath, eyes and head), madatyaya (alcoholic toxicity), trsna (thirst), la vanasyata (salty taste in 
the mouth), kustha (skin disorders), vatarakta (gout), raktapitta (bleeding disorders), katu and 
imlodgara (pungent and sour eructation), bhrama (giddiness). 

If the curable diseases are not responded even after the administration of the suitable drugs 
having the properties like hot, cold, dry, unctuous etc; it can be inferred that the person is 
- offering from the disease born by the vitiation of blood. 

In order to drain out the vitiated blood venesection is to be conducted for the management of 
vuch diseases born by blood.

Procedure of siravedhana at other places not mentioned in the text: 



384 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

By knowing the method of conducting venesection at various places in the body with the above 
description, a wise physician can even perform venesection in other parts of the body by 
applying his mind. 

Instrument differs with musculature: 

Give an incision with vrihimukha sastra (trocar having the pointed tip in a shape of a grain) 
where there is excessive musculature and with kutharika sastra (small instrument with axe 
shaped) in case of less musculature in a size of rice grain and half of the grain respectively. 

Signs of proper, inadequate and excessive incision: 

* In proper incision, blood flows out steadily and stops when tourniquet is released. 

* If the incision is not adequate less quantity of blood flows freely for a short time. Hence to 
promote bleeding it should be rubbed with the mixture of oil and slaked lime. 

* Severe bleeding with sound occurs and stops with great difficulty will be seen in excessive 
incision. 

Reasons for not flowing the blood freely even after giving proper incision: 
^^f^^|^(^c^l^U(iVl^lfri^idi|: 113 5 II 

Fear, fainting, loose and tight tourniquet, over eating, debility, using blunt instruments, 
suppression of natural urges, without sudation therapy and the blockage of channels due to the 
vitiation of kapha etc.

Blood vitiated by vata will be bluish or reddish in color, dry, flows out with force, clear and 
frothy. 

Blood vitiated by pitta will be yellowish or black in color and has foul smell, thin and mixed 
with shiny particles. 

W here as the blood vitiated by kapha will be unctuous, whitish, thread like, slimy and thick. 
If it is vitiated by any of the two dosas mixed features will be seen. If all the tridosas vitiate 
the blood, it looks like dirty and turbid.

It should not be allowed to flow more than the above-mentioned quantity, even in the strong 
persons other wise many a number of complications may arise, and death may also happen. 

agement of the complications — abhyanga (oil massage), rasa (mutton soup), ksira (milk), 
administration of blood of animals like goat and sheep. 

en after the above methods the bleeding persists, thermal or chemical cauterization is 
ated.

Sastra-karma: 

WFT Wt&nA WMM f^TF cTFT fafe W^fM^: I (Padarthacandrika commentary) 
Indication of surgical therapy: 

In both the exogenous and endogenous diseases, if the medical treatment fails, then only go for 
the surgical therapy. 

Measures to be taken for the management of inflammation before surgery: 

In general ulcer develops after pus formation, which is preceded by swelling. 

Hence, the dosika predominance of the swelling should be identified and managed with the 
following measures such as— external application with cold substances, pouring liquid 
substances, blood letting, and other purificatory measures like emesis and purgation. 
Even after the above measures the swelling doesn't subsides, prefer vilayana (liquefaction) 
followed by upanaha (poultices). 

Sopha (Swelling): 

Sopha is of 3 types viz. 

(a) Ama sopha (b) Pacyamana sopha (c) Pakva sopha. 

(a) Features of ama sopha (Un-ripened swelling): 

^ft^S^SFTtW^WT: Ucjuf: chfciH: f^TT: 1I2II 

* Mild swelling. 

* Mild temperature on the region of swelling. 

* Mild pain. 

* Without any discoloration of the skin. 

* Hardness etc. are the features of ama sopha.

* Discoloration of the region, redness and swelling looks like the urinary bladder filled with 
air. 

* Continuous bursting type of pain. 

* Splitting pain all over the body, yawning, inflammation. 

* Anorexia, burning sensation, thirst, fever, insomnia. 

* Melting of solid ghee when placed on the region of swell-ing and tenderness are the feature 
of pacyamana sopha. 

Notes: 

In addition to the above symptoms, the author of Astanga Saiigraha, the following also being 
considerd as the features of pacyamana sopha.

* Pitting by pressure and fills quickly. 

* Pus moves inside the wound similar to the water in a leather bag.

Relationship of tridosas and swelling: 

4Hf) 4rbl^ Mich: <WI<dl <{l$: fivflftlrl: I 

There will be no pain without vata, no burning sensation without pitta, no swelling without 
kapha, any redness and formation of pus without rakta. Hence the swelling is formed due to the 
involvement of all the tridosas along with the blood. 



Sastrakarma- Vidhi Adhyaya : 29 



399 



Features of ati pakva sopha:

ch a state of swelling produced by the vitiation of kapha, ripening take place slowly and 
the complete signs are invisible. It is cold in touch, and the color resembles the skin. Pain also 
mild in nature. It is very hard in touch similar to stone. Basing on the above signs and symptoms 
n intelligent physician can undoubtedly diagnosed it as raktapaka.

such as nasal polyps, malignant tumors etc. and also in the chronic ulcers due to the 
vitiation of all the tridosas. 

* Caustic alkalies are also can be administered internally in case of difficult disease 
conditions. Therefore caustic alkalies are definitely superior among all the sharp and 
accessary instruments. 

Types of k s aras:

(a) Abhyantara parimarjana (internal administration) 

(b) Bahya parimarjana (external application)

Tvpes of bahya parimariana according to the mode of preparation: 
It is of 3 types such as: 

(a) Madhyama ksara (moderate alkalies) 

(b) Mrdu ksara (mild alkalies) 

(c) Tiksna ksara (strong alkalies) 

(a) Madhyama k s arapaka-vidhi: 

* During saradrtu, on an auspicious day, the physician should purify himself, wearing white 
clothes, should go to a big kala muskaka tree of the middle age, which is not damaged. 

* He should worship it and pray to the Gods of tree. 

* The next day he doesn't witness any unnatural omen, should go to the tree early in the 
morning immediately after sunrise, and cut the branches of the tree, which spreads to the 
east or north. 

* Similarly the branches of paribhadra, palasa, asvakarna, rajavrsksa, mahavrksa, vrksaka, 
indravrksa, vrsa, saptacchada, naktamala, tilvaka, kadali, vibhitaki, citraka, apamarga, 
agnimantha, four types of kosataki etc. should be collected along with the roots, fruits, 
leaves and branches and cut into pieces and made into heap. 

* Another heap of crystals of limestone should also be made near the heaps of the logs of 
muskaka, all these set on fire and the ashes are collected. 

* Then take the above ash and add 4 times water and 4 times cow's urine and stirred well and 
then filter it with a thick cloth till a clear, red, thick liquid is obtained. 

* The precipitate is kept on an oven and cooked nicely similar to that of snehapaka. During 
the process add the macerated powder of limestones, paste of the excreta of cock, peacock, 
falcon, heron, pegion; bile juice of animals and birds, haritala, manahsila saindhava lavana 
etc., conch shell and made red hot in an iron pan and then made it cool. 

* This should be kept in a heap of barley for preservation. This is the method of preparing 
madhayama ksarapaka.

(b) Mrdu k s arapaka-vidhi: 

The process of preparation of mrdu ksara is almost similar to madhyama ksara. At the end only 
the macerated powder of lime stones, conch shell etc. are put into the oven during the process of 
cooking. There is no need of adding the paste of prativapa dravya. 

(c) Tik sna ks arapaka-vidhi: 

* The method of preparation of tiksna ksara is also similar to madhyama ksara. In addition to 
prativapa dravyas mentioned in madhyama ksara, the ashes of langali, danti, citraka, 



Ksara-Agnikarma-Vidhi Adhyaya : 30

ativisa, vaca, sarja ksara, swarnaksiri, hingu, putikaranja patra, tala patri and bidalavana 
are also to be added. 
* This should be used after 7 days, depending upon the strength of the disease. 

Indications of different types of ksara: 



* Tiksna ksara is indicated in arbuda and other disorders caused by the vitiation of vata, 
kapha and medas. 

* Madhyama ksara should be used in arbuda and other diseases when they are having 
moderate strength. 

Where as mrdu ksara is indicated in arsas arise due to the dominancy of pitta and rakta. 
Method of potenciating ksara: 

If the potency of ksara is found to have become weak, it should again be dissolved in alkaline 
solution.

ground from a little height forms like a small peak), 8. sukha-nirvapya (easily dissolving), 9. 
I . isyandi (no exudations) and 10. na ca atiruk{ox) alparuk (causing little pain) — these are the 
ten qualities of ksara. 

These ksaras can perform many a number of functions such as excision, incision, extraction, 
s c arification etc. of sharp and accessory instruments as well as cauterization. 

These ksarasby their actions of sucking, tormenting and spreading everywhere, they eradicate 
K oot cause and eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body. After subsiding the pain and 
: her symptoms of the disease, the alkali also subsides of its own accord.

MAULIKA SIDDHANTA 

(BASIC PRINCIPLES) 



SRSTI-UTPATTI 

[CREATION OF UNIVERSE] 



The word \srsti is derived from the dhatu—srji visarge\ which means that is created, produced 
or manifested. Srsti-utpatti krama mentioned in Ayurveda is based on Sankhya and Vaisesika 
philosophies. 

The word 'tattwd is used to denote the causative factors of the creation. According to Sankhya 
darsana, the universe is created by twentyfive (25) tattwas and mentioned that prakrti and 
purusa are the basic causative factors for the creation. Susruta also expressed the similar 
opinion. 

Neither prakrti nor purusa is able to do creation independently. When prakrti comes in contact 
with purusa, prakrti gets stimulated and united together and loses its balance, which leads to a 
variety of changes. These changes result in creation and the evolutionary process is as follows.

According to the Sankhya philosophy everything in the universe looked upon as the result of 
the transformation within one primordial substance known as prakrti. The subject of the 
knowledge is called purusa and the object of knowledge is prakrti As prakrti is the primordial 
cause of the universe of everything excepting only soul, which is uncaused, and accounts for 
whatever is physical, both matter and force, it is called pradhana. All creation is the result of a 
relationship established between these two. Still there is a unity which underlies this duality.

Synonyms of prakrti: 

1 . Pradhana: As it is the primordial substance for the creation. 

2. Avidya: Which is devoid of knowledge. 

3. Maya: Which causes for a variety of creation. 

4. Sakti: Substratum for energy. 

5. A vyakta: As the entire creation is concealed in it in a subtle form. 
Avyakta: 

^sMMIlftlgM ^cft^ebMi ^IcIMI^I (Su.Sa. 1/3) 

A vyakta is responsible for the creation of entire universe and is causeless for its manifestation, 
characterized by trigunas viz. sattva, rajas and tamas, having eight forms (avyakta, mahat, 
ahahkara and five (5) tanmatras). It is one and one only and the substratum for numerous souls 
similar to an ocean, which is a substratum for many a number of aquatic mobile and immobile 
beings such as fish, lotus etc.

Mahat tattwa: 

The first and the foremost basic element manifested from avyakta is known as mahat or buddhi 
tattwa (intelligence). It is the element which takes the decisions while doing any actions and 
differentiates between the right and wrong. It possesses all the trigunas. 

Ahahkara: 

Ahahkara is manifested from mahat or buddhi tattva and is also known as egoism. Ahahkara 
also contains trigunas in a state of imbalanced state, so that variation of different individuals 
can be seen. Depending on the dominance of trigunas, it is of three (3) types viz. 

1 . Sattvika ahahkara or vaikarika 

2. Rajasika ahahkara or taijasa 

3 . Tamasika ahahkara or bhutadi 

• Sattvika ahahkara with the initiation of rajasika ahahkara leads to the formation of 
ekadasa indriyas viz. 

1 . Pahca jhancdiiyas — srotendriya, twagindriya (sparsanendriya), caksurindriya, 
rasanendriya and ghranendriya. 

2. Pahca karmendriyas — vak, hasta, upastha, payu and pada. 
^ii* 3. Manas. 



Maulika Siddhanta

• Tamasika ahankara with the initiation of rajasika ahankara leads to the formation of: 

1. Pahca tanmatras viz. sabda tanmatra, sparsa tanmatra, rupa tanmatra, rasa 
tanmatra and gandha tanmatra. These five (5) tanmatras possess five visesa 
gunas and evolve; 

2. Pahca mahabhutas viz. akasa, vayu, tejasjala and prthivi. 

In this way all the twentyfive (25) tatty as necessary for creation are evolved. 
Classification of tattvas: 

According to the Sahkhya philosophy, all the twentyfive (25) tattvas have been classified into 
four groups as under. 

1. Prakrti one(l) 

2. Vikrti sixteen (16) 

3. Prakrti-vikrti seven (7) 

4. Na prakrti-na vikrti one ( 1 ) 

1. Prakrti: 

The basic element which manifests the rest of tattvas is known as prakrti or mula prakrti. But it 
is not being created by any other substance. 

2. Vikrti: 

These types of elements are being created from other tattvas and they are unable to create any 
other elements. They are sixteen (16) in number viz. eleven (11) indriyas and five (5) 
mahabhutas. 

3. Prakrti-vikrti: 

These types of elements are being created from other tattvas and they are able to create other 
elements. They are seven (7) in number viz. mahat, ahankara and five (5) tanmatras. 

4. Na prakrti-na vikrti: 

This tattva cannot be produced any other element and itself is not created by any other, i.e. 
purusa.

"Tattvantarotpadanatvam prakrtitwam" 

That which produces or creates other tattvas is known as prakrti. Among twenty four (24) 
tattvas\ avyakta, mahat, ahankara and five (5) tanmatras are called as astavidha prakrti 
(causative source) and the rest of sixteen ( 1 6) are considered as sodasa vikara (products | .

TANTRA YUKTI- VICARA 

[MAJOR DEVICES] 



In the good olden days each and every scientific work, irrespective of its subject matter was 
written in accordance with Tantrayuktis or the Major Devices. The scientific works written in 
brief need not contain all the 36 major devices. In other words the number of devices in a 
scientific treatise depends upon the volume of subject matter. 

The word tantryukti comprises two constituents viz. tantra and yukti. Tantra means a science or 
scientific treatise and yukti means a device. Thus tantryukti means devices of composing a 
irientific treatise. It is not possible to compose a scientific work without tantrayuktis or major 
devices. 

ese devices are 32 in number according to Kautilya and Susruta (Uttaratantra 65 th chapter), 
bereas Maharsi Caraka and Vagbhata enumerated the number of tantrayuktis as 36, in the 1 2 th 
chapter of Siddhisthana of Caraka Sarhhita and 50 th chapter of Uttaratantra respectively, 
hattara Haricandra, the commentator on Caraka Samhita has recognized four (4) more 
ices and enumerated 40 tantrayuktis.

maintenance of positive health in a healthy individual and giving treatment to the diseased is

over again. If the same subject matter is repeated again and again the reader gets bored and do at 
times will be doubtful about the validity of such descriptions. Hence an ideal scientific work 
should be devoid of punarukta tantra dosa.

KALPANAS 
Saptavidha Kalpanas 

(Seven (7) Minor Devices) 

After the enumeration of tantrayuktis\ 7 types of minor devices known as saptavidha kalpanas 
are described by Arunadatta. 

L Pradhanasya kalpana 4. Lesa kalpana 7. Ajiia kalpana 

2. Pradhanena kalpana 5. Vidy a kalpana 

3. Gunakalpana 6. Bhaksy a kalpana

knowledge of scientific works. An asraya means a prop or a support. These asrayas gives 
support to a scientific concept to keep it in position. Arunadatta, the commentator of Astanga 
Hrdaya has enumerated 20 arthasrayas. Whereas Sankara Sarma, the author of tantrayuktis

4. Ubhayapada lopa: 

Ellipses or omission of words at two places i.e. in the middle and at the end of a statement is 
known as ubhayapada lopa. Here simply by hearing the initial words of the statement it is 
understood completely, though the later words are missing. 

Ex.: though the food contains all the six tastes, during the process of digestion it is transformed

Supply of the missing word by the commentators in the later stage is known as varnopajaiiana. 
Arunadatta himself quoted that it is identical with vakyasesa type of tantrayukti. 



528 Astanga Hrdayam : Sut ra-sthanu 

8. Rsi-klista : 

When a preceptor in a state of inattention or physical inability mispronounces a word, it is 
received as it is by the student and gains popularity. 

Ex.: the correct word is 'roma\ but due to mispronunciation the word 'loma' has become 
popular. 

9. Tantrasila: 

a^fioi hih — ^TTd^chUUi y<£frJ: W^MN $rH$tf: I

topics elaborately (wherever necessary) for the benefit of the readers is known as tantrasila. 

10. Tantra-samjna: 

Accepting a specific meaning from several meanings of a technical term by taking the context 
into account is known as tantra-samjna.

be taken as mercury. 

11. Prakrtakhya: 

yi<£d nm — y^du^^i 

Interpretation of the words in a scientific treatise according to the context is known as 
prakrtakhya. 

Ex.: (a) in the context of war, the word 'saindhavd should be taken to mean a 'horse' and when it 
is that of medicine; it should be taken to mean 'rock salt'. 

(b) while describing oudbhida-gana dravyas as ksara, ksira, phala, puspa, bhasma etc. in the 
present context— ksira means milky latex and not to mean milk of a cow. 

12. Samana-tantra pratyaya: 

To establish a concept by consulting another scientific work on one's own discipline is known 
as samana-tantra pratyaya. Do at times the author fails to explain the concept and expects the 
commentator to fill the lacuna. The commentator accomplishes the task with the help of this 
asrayaby referring the scientific works of the same discipline. 

13. Paratantra pratyaya: 

md^yrij4l hw — <ljhii^hi u faH&dl ^ fcictf^y^ui yicKwRrar?j niui^i'csrtfiiMct) d-^: i 



Maulika Siddhanta 



529

Ex.: referring vaisesika darsana for knowing more about sad padarthas mentioned in 
Ayurveda. 

14. Hetu-hetuka dharma: 

Hetu means a major or potential cause. Hetuka means a minor or incidental cause. To infer 
dharma after knowing both hetu and hetuka is known as hetu-hetuka dharma. In other 
words — when a number of causes are mentioned for an effect, considering the more reasonable 
and the potent cause is known as hetu-hetuka dharma. This asraya helps to draw a line of 
demarcation between the major and minor causes of an effect. 

Ex.: pittatisara leads to raktatisara. Here pitta is the primary cause for raktatisara and not the 
atisara. 

15. Karya-karana dharma: 

To speak of an effect as a cause and cause as an effect in a secondary sense is known as karya- 
karana dharma. 

Ex.: rogas do at times called as dosas and vice versa. 

16. Adyanta viparyaya: 

To alter the sequence of the arrangement of the chapters or subject matter contrary to previous 
one or the original order according to pratijna vakya for valid reasons is known as adyanta 
viparyaya. 

17.Sabdanyatwa: 

To recommend or make a note of identical scientific terms is known as sabdanyatwa. These 
>ynonyms will be helpful for clear understanding of a scientific work without any ambiguity. 

Ex.: papma, jwara, vyadhi, vikara, duhkha, amaya, yaksma, atanka, gada, badha etc. are the 
5) nonyms for roga. 

18. Pratyaya dharma: 

Keeping the real cause of the effect hidden and giving importance to the insignificant cause is 
known as pratyaya dharma. 



530 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana 

Ex: though prajnaparadha is the real cause for unmada, giving undue importance to the 
insignificant cause of invasion of pisacas. 

19. Upanaya: 

<im4) HIM— ^rjyfdl^H ^l^cVlcMUiyM^)^ I 

Upanaya is to draw near or closer. That means deliberating the allied subject matter in 
introducing a major topic. 

Ex.: after introducing the topic on the quantity of food (matrahara adhyaya), begins to discuss 
about the disease condition ' visucikS, resulting from excessive intake of food. 

20. Sambhava: 

Mentioning the major topics or subject matter briefly, what the author intended to discuss in 
detail in his work is known as sambhava arthasraya. 

Ex.: mentioning of "kayabalagraha...Jaravrsan" reveals that the author intended to explain in 
detail about all the 8 branches of Ayurveda in his work. 

21. Vibhava: 

Since Arunadatta's manuscript is mutilated after the word bhangya it is not possible to 

formulate a precise idea about vibhava.

ABOUT THE BOOK 

This book Astanga Hrdaya : Sutra 

Sthana is first of its kind in the history of 
Ayurvedic literature, which has been 
presented with a maximum number of 
illustrations for better understanding the 
subject matter by the freshly joined 
students of Ayurveda. As a teacher of the 
concerned subject for the past 15 years, 
the author has identified the necessity of 
proper study material in English language 
to cater the needs of T year BAMS 
students. Keeping this in view the author 
has made an attempt to incorporate the 
translation of the text along with the 
related matter compiled from other 
Compendiums in the form of notes. The
